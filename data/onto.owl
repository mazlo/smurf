Situated at the juncture of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, it is bounded to the west by the Black Sea, to the north by Russia, to the south by Turkey and Armenia, and to the east by Azerbaijan. Georgia covers a territory of 69,700&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; and its population is 4.385 million.
The history of Georgia can be traced back to the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia, and it was one of the first countries to adopt Christianity, in the 4th century. Georgia reached the peak of its political and economic strength during the reign of King David and Queen Tamar in 11th and 12th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Georgia was annexed by the Russian Empire. After a brief period of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia was invaded by Bolshevik armies in 1921 and incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922.
The independence of Georgia was restored in 1991. Like many post-communist countries, Georgia suffered from the economic crisis and civil unrest during the 1990s. After the Rose Revolution, the new&lt;/p&gt;

She is depicted as a 14-year-old Togruta female. However, acording to Lucas, she was only 11 when the Clone Wars began.
George Lucas stated that the character of Ahsoka was developed for the series as a means of illustrating how Anakin Skywalker develops from the brash, undisciplined Padawan in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones to the more reserved Jedi Knight in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Giving Anakin his own Padawan would place the character into a paternal role where he would be forced to become more cautious and responsible. It would also give Anakin new insight into his relationship with his own mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and explain how their relationship matured. Lucas stated that, having raised two daughters, he &quot;knew something about the subject,&quot; and decided to make Anakin&#39;s apprentice a young female.
Ahsoka Tano is discovered by Master Plo Koon and raised in the Jedi Temple. She graduates to Padawan at an early age, both due to the ongoing Clone Wars and as an effort&lt;/p&gt;

He later won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Colonel Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai. His most prominent role in his later career was as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars trilogy.
Guinness was born at 155 Lauderdale Mansions South, Lauderdale Road, Maida Vale, London as Alec Guinness De Cuffe. His mother&#39;s maiden name was Agnes Cuff. She was born 8 December 1890 to Edward Cuff and Mary Ann Cuff Benfield. On Guinness&#39;s birth certificate, the field for mother&#39;s name displays Agnes de Cuffe. In the field for the infant&#39;s name (where first names only are usually given), it says Alec Guinness. There is nothing written in the column for name and surname of father. On this basis it has been frequently speculated that the actor&#39;s father was a member of the Irish Guinness family.

Sebastian Shaw portrayed Anakin in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi in the scenes where Darth Vader&#39;s helmet is removed and when he appears as a Force-ghost with Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi.

It consists of the main island of Anguilla itself, approximately 26&amp;#160;km (16&amp;#160;mi) long by 5&amp;#160;km (3.1&amp;#160;mi) wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and cays with no permanent population. The island&#39;s capital is The Valley. The total land area of the territory is 91&amp;#160;km (35&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi), with a population of approximately 13,500 (2006 estimate).
Anguilla was first settled by Amerindian tribes who migrated from South America. The earliest Amerindian artifacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300 BC, and remains of settlements date from 600 AD. The date of European discovery is uncertain: some sources claim that Columbus sighted the island in 1493, while others state that the island was first discovered by the French in 1564 or 1565. The name Anguilla derives from the word for &quot;eel&quot; in any of various Romance languages (modern Spanish: anguila; French: anguille; Italian: anguilla), probably chosen because of the island&#39;s eel-like shape.
Anguilla was first colonised by English settlers from&lt;/p&gt;

Its prehistoric peoples had no written language; analyses of archaeological excavations were used to develop current knowledge of their existence.
Antigua was first settled by Archaic Age hunter-gatherer Amerindians, erroneously referred to as Siboney or Cibony. Carbon-dating has established that the earliest settlements started around 3100 BCE. They were succeeded by the Ceramic Age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower Orinoco River.
The Arawaks introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua Black Pineapple (Moris cultivar of Ananas comosus), corn, sweet potatoes (white with firmer flesh than the bright orange &quot;sweet potato&quot; used in&lt;/p&gt;

For at least 40,000 years before European settlement in the late 18th century, the Australian mainland and Tasmania were inhabited by around 250 language groups of indigenous Australians. After sporadic visits by fishermen from the immediate north, and discovery by Dutch explorers in 1606, the eastern half of Australia was claimed by the British in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in the following years; the continent was explored, and another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies were established during the 19th century.

The need for a National Territory was flagged by colonial delegates during the Federation conventions of the late 19th century. Section 125 of the Australian Constitution provided that following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new Federal Government. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by the state of New South Wales in 1911, two years prior to the naming of Canberra as the National Capital in 1913.
The floral emblem of the ACT is the Royal Bluebell and the faunal emblem is the Gang-gang Cockatoo.
The ACT is bounded by the Goulburn-Cooma railway line in the east, the watershed of Naas Creek in the south, the watershed of the Cotter River in the west, and the watershed of the Molonglo River in the north-east.

Bail Prestor Organa is the Viceroy and Prince of the planet Alderaan, the husband of Queen Breha Organa, and Princess Leia Organa&#39;s adoptive father. In the waning days of the Old Republic, he also serves as Alderaan&#39;s representative in the Galactic Senate, succeeded later by the adult Leia.
Organa is mentioned in the Expanded Universe many times. A scene involving him was scripted but cut from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
Senator Organa seconded Queen Amidala of Naboo&#39;s vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum, paving the way for Senator Palpatine to become Supreme Chancellor. (Note: This scene was filmed with a different actor but eventually cut.)
As a prominent member of the Senate&#39;s Loyalist Committee, Organa realizes early on that the Separatists are a serious threat, and are going down a path that could only lead to war. He reluctantly approves of granting vast emergency powers to Chancellor Palpatine.

Habitation on the banks of the Brunei River can be traced back to the 7th century where there had been settlements similar to those in Kampong Ayer, located on areas close to the present site of the Brunei Museum.
Seri Begawan was named after the Sultan&#39;s late father Sir Omar Ali Saifuddien on 5 October 1970, its original name being Bandar Brunei. Begawan is a name given to Bruneian monarchs who have abdicated, originally coming from the Sanskrit word for &quot;god&quot;: &amp;#2349;&amp;#2327;&amp;#2357;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2344; bhagav&amp;#257;n. Seri also comes from the honorific Sanskrit word Sri. Bandar, comes from Persian &amp;#1576;&amp;#1606;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1585; via Indian languages and means &quot;port&quot; or &quot;haven&quot; (bandar means &quot;town&quot; in Malay).
On 1 August 2007, The Sultan of Brunei gave consent for the extension of Bandar Seri Begawan from 12.87 square kilometres to 100.36 square kilometres. For a list of the included villages and mukims see &quot;Expansion of the City&quot; below.
Bandar Seri Begawan is located at 4&amp;#176;53&#39;25&quot;N, 114&amp;#176;56&#39;32&quot;E, on the northern bank of the Brunei River.

Banjul is on St Mary&#39;s Island (Banjul Island), where the Gambia River enters the Atlantic Ocean. The island is connected to the mainland&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; by passenger and vehicle ferries to the north and by bridges to the south.
Banjul takes it name from the Mand&amp;#233; people who gathered specific fibres on the island which were used in the manufacture of ropes. Bang julo is the mandinka (Mande) word for fibre. The mispronounciation led to the word Banjul.
In 1816, the British founded Banjul as a trading post and base for suppressing the slave trade. It was first named Bathurst after Henry Bathurst, the secretary of the British Colonial Office, but was changed to Banjul in 1973.
On July 22, 1994 Banjul was the scene of a bloodless military coup d&#39;&amp;#233;tat in which President Dawda Jawara was overthrown and replaced by the country&#39;s current President Yahya Jammeh. To commemorate this event,&lt;/p&gt;

Belgravia is approximately bounded by Knightsbridge to the north (the street of that name, not the district), Grosvenor Place and Buckingham Palace Road to the east, Pimlico Road to the south, and Sloane Street to the west.
Most of the area was owned by Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, who had it developed from the 1820s. Thomas Cubitt was the main contractor. Belgravia is characterised by grand terraces of white stucco houses, and is focused on the Belgrave Square and Eaton Square. It was one of London&#39;s most fashionable residential districts from the beginning, and remains so to this day. It is a relatively quiet district in the heart of London, contrasting with neighbouring districts which have far more busy shops, large modern office buildings, hotels, and entertainment venues.

Although Kriol and Spanish are spoken among the population, Belize is the only country in Central America where English is the official language. Belize is bordered by Mexico to its north, by Guatemala to its south and west, and by the Caribbean Sea to the east.
With 8,867 square miles (22,960&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;) of land and 320,000 people (2008 est.), the population density of Belize is the lowest in the Central American region, and it also has one of the lowest population densities in the world. However, the country&#39;s population growth rate, 2.21% (2008 est.), is the highest in the region and one of the highest in the western hemisphere. Belize&#39;s abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems contributes to Mesoamerica&#39;s designation as a biodiversity &quot;hotspot&quot;.

The government was moved to Belmopan in 1970, and its National Assembly Building is designed to resemble a Pre-Columbian Maya temple.
After Hurricane Hattie, with winds of up to 300&amp;#160;kilometres per hour (190&amp;#160;mph), and following the destruction of approximately 75% of the houses and business places in Belize City, the government of the day proposed to encourage and promote the building of a new capital city. This new capital would be situated on better terrain, would entail no costly reclamation of land, and would also provide for an industrial area. In 1962, a committee chose the site now known as Belmopan, located 82 kilometres (51&amp;#160;miles) west of the old capital of Belize City.

It is the most populous British city outside London with a population of 1,016,800 (2008 estimate), and lies at the heart of the West Midlands conurbation, the United Kingdom&#39;s second most populous Urban Area with a population of 2,284,093 (2001 census). Birmingham&#39;s metropolitan area, which includes surrounding towns to which it is closely tied through commuting, is the United Kingdom&#39;s second most populous with a population of 3,683,000.
Birmingham was the powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution in England, a fact which led to it being known as &quot;the workshop of the world&quot; or the &quot;city of a thousand trades&quot;. Although Birmingham&#39;s industrial importance has declined, it has developed into a national commercial centre, being named as the second-best place in the United Kingdom to locate a business. Birmingham is a national hub for conferences, retail and events along with an established high tech, research and development sector, supported by its three Universities.

Bishkek is also the administrative centre of Chuy Province which surrounds the city, even though the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.
The name is thought to derive from a Kyrgyz word for a churn used to make fermented mare&#39;s milk (kumis), the Kyrgyz national drink. Founded in 1825 as the Kyrgyz-Khokand fortress of &quot;&quot;Bishkek&quot;, then, in 1862, named as the Russian fortress Pishpek (&amp;#1082;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1087;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1100; &amp;#1055;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1096;&amp;#1087;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1082;), in 1926 the city was renamed Frunze (&amp;#1060;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1079;&amp;#1077;), after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament restored the city&#39;s historical name.
Bishkek is situated at about 800&amp;#160;metres (2,600&amp;#160;ft) altitude just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range, which rises up to 4,855&amp;#160;metres (15,928&amp;#160;ft) and provides a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The Chui River drains most of the area.

The Star Wars Expanded Universe expands on Fett&#39;s origins and career as a bounty hunter. Fett&#39;s air of danger and mystery have created a cult following for the character, who has been merchandised across multiple media. Fett might be part of the live-action Star Wars series under development.
In 2008, Boba Fett was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time. He was also included on Fandomania&#39;s list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters.
Fett first appeared at the September 24, 1978, San Anselmo Country Fair parade.

Born in the Gungan city of Otoh Gunga, Rugor Nass quickly cut a figure above his contemporaries with his warrior&#39;s spirit and unwavering determination. He became a legend among his people by winning the Big Nasty Free-For-All, a gruelling physical challenge in the annual Gungan Festival of Warriors, an unprecedented three years in a row. By the time the elections for Top Boss came around, everybody knew who Nass was, and he won the race in a landslide. 

Rather more conservative than the other Gungan leaders (and physically different from most of them, as he was of the older, heavier-set Ankura Gungan race), Nass developed a reputation for stern, no-nonsense, yet fair and just leadership. Exceedingly proud of his city, Nass made unprecedented steps towards civic improvement, the most notable being the construction of the public concourse he dubbed City Bigspace. Nass even showed remarkable patience with the ever-bungling Jar Jar Binks, letting the hapless Gungan off with minor punishments for his misdeeds where&lt;/p&gt;

Other than Black Rock and parts of Brooklawn which were originally part of the Town of Fairfield, Bridgeport was originally a part of the Town of Stratford. The first settlement was made in 1659. It was called Pequonnock until 1695, when its name was changed to Stratfield, because of its location between the already existing towns of Stratford and Fairfield. During the American Revolution it was a center of privateering. In 1800, the borough of Bridgeport was chartered, and in 1821 the township was incorporated. The city was not chartered until&lt;/p&gt;

Brunei can trace its beginnings to the 7th century when it was a subject state of the Srivijayan empire under the name Po-ni.

Burbank is located in two distinct areas, with its downtown, civic center and key neighborhoods nestled on the slopes and foothills that rise to the Verdugo Mountains, and other areas located in flatlands at the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley, 12&amp;#160;miles (19&amp;#160;km) north of Downtown Los Angeles.
Billed as the &quot;Media Capital of the World,&quot; many media and entertainment companies are headquartered or have significant production facilities in Burbank, including Warner Bros. Entertainment, Warner Music Group, NBC Universal, The Walt Disney Company, Cartoon Network, Viacom, and PBS.
At one time it was referred to as &quot;Beautiful Downtown Burbank&quot; on Laugh-In and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.
The city was named after David Burbank, a New Hampshire-born dentist and entrepreneur.
The city of Burbank occupies land that was originally part of two Spanish and Mexican-era colonial land grants, the 36,400-acre (147&amp;#160;km) Rancho San Rafael, granted to Jose Maria Verdugo by the Spanish Bourbon government in 1784, and the 4,063-acre (16.44&amp;#160;km) Rancho Providencia created in 1821.&lt;/p&gt;

He is also a major character in the television show Droids, and appears frequently in the series&#39; &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; of novels, comic books, and video games. C-3PO is one of the four characters to appear in all six of the Star Wars feature films, and one of only two characters portrayed by the same actor in all six installments of the series (the other being Kenny Baker as R2-D2). In all his various appearances, he is portrayed by Anthony Daniels.
C-3PO is a protocol droid designed to serve humans, and boasts that he is fluent &quot;in over six million forms of communication.&quot; C-3PO is generally seen with his long-time counterpart, R2-D2, a small, quirky droid. Threepio&#39;s main function as a protocol droid is to assist with etiquette, customs, and translation so that meetings of different cultures run smoothly. Along side of the astromech droid R2-D2, Threepio played a vital and pivotal role in the Galaxy&#39;s history.

It was named in honor of the University of Cambridge in England, a nexus of the Puritan theology embraced by the town&#39;s founders. Notably, Cambridge is home to two internationally prominent universities, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. According to a 2008 census estimate the city population was 105,594. It is the fourth most populous city in the state, behind Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. Cambridge is one of the two county seats of Middlesex County (Lowell is the other).
The site for what would become Cambridge was chosen in December 1630, because it was located safely up river from Boston Harbor, which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. Also, the water from the local spring was so good that the local Natives believed it had medicinal properties. The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as &quot;the newe towne&quot;. Official Massachusetts records show the name capitalized as Newe Towne by 1632. Located at the first convenient Charles River crossing west of Boston, Newe Towne was one&lt;/p&gt;

Cameroon&#39;s coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. The country is called &quot;Africa in miniature&quot; for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is Mount Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaound&amp;#233;, and Garoua. Cameroon is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team. English and French are the official languages.
Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest.

It is the world&#39;s second largest country by total area. Canada&#39;s common border with the United States to the south and northwest is the longest in the world.
The land occupied by Canada was inhabited for millennia by various groups of Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 after the Seven Years&#39; War. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster of 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.
A federation consisting of ten provinces and three territories, Canada is governed&lt;/p&gt;

With a population of over 345,000, it is Australia&#39;s largest inland city and the eighth largest Australian city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory, 280&amp;#160;km (170&amp;#160;mi) south-west of Sydney, and 660&amp;#160;km (410&amp;#160;mi) north-east of Melbourne.
The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation&#39;s capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia&#39;s two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city. Following an international contest for the city&#39;s design, a design by the Chicago architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913.
The city&#39;s design was heavily influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation that have earned Canberra the title &quot;bush capital&quot;. Although the growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, it emerged as a thriving city after World War II.

He attended many of the same offworld training academies as his uncle and fought under Panaka&#39;s command in the Battle of Naboo, where he lost his left eye.
He makes his first appearance in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones as the new bodyguard for Senator Padm&amp;#233; Amidala. Her previous protector was Captain Panaka, who is Typho&#39;s uncle.
Captain Typho survives the attack on Amidala&#39;s ship and pleads with her to get herself out of harm&#39;s way on the Coruscant landing platform. He is grateful when the Jedi Council offers extra assistance in Amidala&#39;s protection.
Typho saw off Padm&amp;#233; and her Jedi protector Anakin Skywalker as they left for Naboo (Typho stayed on Coruscant with handmaiden Dorm&amp;#233;). When Anakin&#39;s mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi told Typho he was worried about Anakin trying something &quot;foolish&quot; with Padme, Typho responded that he should be worried about her doing something.

It is situated at the mouth of the Barry Burn on the North Sea coast. In the 2001 census, Carnoustie had a population of 10,561, making it the fourth largest town in Angus.
The town was founded in the late 18th century, and grew rapidly throughout the 19th century due to the expansion of the local textile industry. It was popular as a tourist resort from the early Victorian era up to the latter half of the 20th century, due to its seaside location. It is best known for its associations with golf.
Carnoustie can be considered a dormitory town for its closest city, Dundee, which is 11&amp;#160;miles (18&amp;#160;km) to the west. It is served by Carnoustie railway station, and less so by Golf Street railway station. Its nearest major road is the A92.
The origin of the name Carnoustie is uncertain, although it possibly derives from the Gaelic C&amp;#224;rn fheusta, meaning &#39;fort of the feast&#39;. It is also possible that it has an earlier Pictish origin, predating the gaelicisation of Angus.

Castries is located in a flood gut and is actually built on reclaimed land. It houses the seat of government and the head offices of many of the businesses both foreign and local. The city&#39;s design is in a grid pattern similar to a metropolitan city like New York but on a much smaller scale. It has a sheltered harbour which receives cargo vessels and ferry boats as well as cruise ships. It contains duty free shopping facilities such as Point Seraphine and La Place Carinage; many restaurants which offer varied menus from local to Chinese; supermarkets and many other shopping facilities. The city is well serviced by a bus system and taxi service.
St Lucia&#39;s main post office is located in Castries. Because most parts of the country do not use standard street addresses, mail is largely sent to P.O. boxes. Any mail sent without a town name ends up in the Castries post office.

The territory comprises the islands of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little Cayman, located south of Cuba and northwest of Jamaica. The territory is a major offshore financial centre in the Caribbean.
The Cayman Islands were sighted by Christopher Columbus, on 10 May 1503 on his fourth and final voyage to the New World. He named the islands Las Tortugas after the numerous sea turtles there. The first recorded English visitor to the islands was Sir Francis Drake, who landed there in 1586 and named them the Cayman Islands after caiman, the Neo-Taino nations&#39; term for alligator.
The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on Grand Cayman around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell&#39;s soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655.
The Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. A variety of people settled on the islands, including pirates, refugees from the Spanish Inquisition, shipwrecked sailors, deserters from Oliver Cromwell&#39;s army&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Chewbacca, nicknamed Chewie, is a Wookiee character in the Star Wars franchise. In the series&#39; narrative chronology, he appears in the films Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.
The character&#39;s creation as a &quot;gentle, hairy, non-English-speaking co-pilot&quot; was inspired by George Lucas seeing his own Alaskan Malamute dog sitting up on the passenger seat of his car. The dog, Indiana, also inspired the name of the lead character in another series of Lucas films, Indiana Jones.
Chewbacca became Han Solo&#39;s first mate and constant companion when Han, then an Imperial Captain, was ordered to kill him because Chewbacca was a slave for the Empire. Han was decommissioned from the Imperial Navy, and later became a smuggler. Since he saved his life, Chewbacca owed a life debt to Han, meaning that he would serve Han for the rest of his life.  Chewbacca was named one of the &quot;greatest sidekicks&quot; in film history by Entertainment Weekly.
In all five appearances, he was portrayed by Peter Mayhew, who was chosen for his height &amp;#8212; 7&#39;3&quot; (2.2 m) at the time of filming. Mayhew&lt;/p&gt;

Nowadays, the spring is located at the corner of Pushkin and Albi&amp;#351;oara streets.

Cockburn Town is located on the largest island in the Turks Islands (not the Caicos) archipelago, Grand Turk Island. Historic 18th and 19th century Bermudian architecture line Duke and Front Streets in Cockburn Town. The town is known for its long, narrow streets and old street lamps.
The closest anchorage to Cockburn Town is Hawk&#39;s Nest Anchorage, which, though sheltered, should only be entered in good light because of reefs near the entrance.
The seat of government ever since 1766, Cockburn Town was the first permanent settlement on any of the islands, founded in 1681 by salt collectors who arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The city supposedly lies on the place where Juan Ponce de Le&amp;#243;n first landed on the island.
Cockburn Town is home to the Turks &amp;amp; Caicos National Museum, which is housed in the colonial-era Guinep House, on Front Street. The house is believed to be over 180 years old and much of its structural material came from local shipwrecks, including a ship&#39;s mast, which is one of the building&#39;s main supports.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Darth Vader is the central antagonist in the Star Wars saga, George Lucas&#39; epic six-film science fiction saga. Vader originally appeared as the Empire&#39;s villainous enforcer in the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV, V, VI), and briefly turns up as a tragic figure near the end of Revenge of the Sith, the third and final film of the Star Wars prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II, III). Lucas, in the audio commentary for Revenge of the Sith, says that he considers both trilogies together to be The Tragedy of Darth Vader.
In the original Star Wars trilogy, Vader is embodied by David Prowse, though Sebastian Shaw makes a brief appearance as the unmasked Vader in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Vader is played by Hayden Christensen. In the original trilogy and Episode III, James Earl Jones provides Vader&#39;s voice when he is masked, although Jones was originally uncredited for this role.
In the original trilogy, George Lucas depicts Darth Vader as a fearsome cyborg who acts as the supreme commander of the brutal Galactic Empire and right hand man of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Throughout the films, Vader oppresses the galaxy&lt;/p&gt;

In Britain, he is also remembered as having played the Green Cross Code man. Prowse is a native of Bristol, where he attended Bristol Grammar School.
Arguably, Prowse is best known for playing the physical form of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. He spoke the dialogue during the filming of the movie, and didn&#39;t actually know Vader was Luke&#39;s father until he saw the movie in the cinema. Though he was never going to be used as the voice of Darth Vader, he was originally told that he would be seen and heard at the end of Return of the Jedi when Vader&#39;s mask was removed. This did not end up happening as actor Sebastian Shaw was brought in instead. However, Lucas claims he wanted a &#39;darker voice&#39; (Lucas has stated that Darth Vader had to have a deep, reverberating voice) that Prowse could not provide and never intended to use Prowse&#39;s voice.

Dominica has been nicknamed the &quot;Nature Isle of the Caribbean&quot; for its seemingly unspoiled natural beauty. It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by geothermal-volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world&#39;s second-largest boiling lake. The island features lush mountainous rainforests, home of many rare plant, animal, and bird species. There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall can be expected inland. The Sisserou Parrot (also known as the Imperial Amazon), the island&#39;s national bird, is featured on the national flag. Dominica&#39;s economy is heavily dependent on both tourism and agriculture.

This character featured in three TV series The XYY Man in the mid-1970s; the later Strangers that saw Bulman rise from Detective Sergeant to Detective Chief Inspector and, in 1985, the series Bulman saw George retired from the police and pursuing a career as a horologist. He also starred in the popular TV drama series Warship.
He lived in his adopted home town of Stratford-upon-Avon for many years, where he was a familiar face to locals. He also had several minor roles at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in the town. In the late 1970s as a relatively unknown actor, whilst walking in Stratford, he was approached by an American tourist who recognised him as having starred in Star Wars, and offered him a thousand dollars in cash for his script. Sadly Don had thrown it away.
Henderson died in Warwick from throat cancer. His widow is the actress Shirley Stelfox with whom he appeared professionally many times.&lt;/p&gt;

The town is the centre of apple production in Western Australia.
The town of Donnybrook was gazetted in 1894. It was first settled around 1842 when George Nash and others moved to the area. They named the place &quot;Donnybrook&quot; after the suburb of Dublin, Ireland that they came from. The eastern part of the town was formerly called Minninup. The western portion of the townsite is currently known as Irishtown.
In 1897, Richard Hunter discovered gold about 6 kilometres south of the Donnybrook townsite. Hunter eventually sold out to Fred Camilleri (a well known prospector from Kalgoorlie) and Camilleri was able to interest the internationally renowned Polish geologist Modest Maryanski. It was on the basis of Maryanski&#39;s report that a new company &quot;Donnybrook Goldfields Ltd&quot; was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1899. A mini gold rush occurred, resulting in the Government gazetting the Donnybrook Goldfield - in the process making provision for a new town to be called &quot;Goldtown&quot;. From the census of 1901, it was known over 200 gold miners&lt;/p&gt;

It is located at the mouth of the River Douglas, and a sweeping bay of two miles. The River Douglas forms part of the town&#39;s harbour and main commercial port.
Douglas is home to the High Courts and the Isle of Man Government.
The town serves as the Island&#39;s main hub for business, finance, shipping, transport, shopping, and entertainment.
The discovery of a bronze weapon in central Douglas, and the large Ballaquayle Viking treasure hoard on the outskirts, both in the 1890s, hint at the early importance of the site now occupied by Douglas. Scholars agree that the name of the town derives from Early Celtic &#39;Duboglassio&#39; meaning &#39;black river&#39; . Douglas is twice referred to in the Monastic &#39;Chronicle of the Kings of Man and the Isles&#39;; first in 1192, when the monks of St Mary&#39;s Abbey at Rushen, were transferred there for a four-year stay, then again in 1313, when Robert (Bruce), King of Scotland, spent the night at the &#39;monastery of Duglas&#39; on his way to seize Castle Rushen.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;English is a West Germanic language that arose in England and south-eastern Scotland in the time of the Anglo-Saxons. Following the economic, scientific, political, cultural and military might of the United Kingdom from the 18th century, and of the United States since the mid 20th century, it has become the lingua franca in many parts of the world, and the leading language in international business and science. It is used widely as a second language and as an official language in the European Union and many Commonwealth countries, as well as in many world organisations.
Historically, English originated from several dialects, now collectively termed Old English, which were brought to the eastern coast of the island of Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers beginning in the 5th century. English was further influenced by the Old Norse language of Viking invaders.
After the time of the Norman conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, borrowing heavily from the Norman-French vocabulary and spelling conventions. The etymology of the word &quot;English&quot; is a derivation from the 12th century Old English englisc from Engle, &quot;[the] Angles&quot;.
Modern English developed with the Great Vowel&lt;/p&gt;

Officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it is the second-most populous nation in Africa with over 79.2 million people and the tenth-largest by area with its 1,100,000&amp;#160;km. The capital is Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is bordered by Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south, Sudan to the west, and Eritrea to the north.
Though most African nations are, in their modern form, less than a century old, Ethiopia has been an independent state since ancient times, being one of the oldest countries in the world. A monarchical state for most of its history, the Ethiopian dynasty traces its roots to the 10th century BC. Besides being an ancient country, Ethiopia is one of the oldest sites of human existence known to scientists today, having yielded some of humanity&#39;s oldest traces, it might be the place where Homo sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. When Africa was divided up by European powers at the Berlin Conference, Ethiopia was one of only two countries that retained its independence. It was one of only four African members of the&lt;/p&gt;

In Episode I, Valorum is the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. The galaxy is troubled by a trade dispute between the Republic and the corrupt Trade Federation, and Valorum secretly dispatches Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to resolve the matter. The negotiations fail, however, when the Federation sends assassin to kill the Jedi. Unbeknownst to Valorum, the threat originates within his own circle of advisors: his closest confidante, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), is secretly funding and advising the Trade Federation as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, as part of a larger scheme to take over the galaxy. 

The situation quickly worsens when the Trade Federation invades the planet Naboo, and Valorum loses nearly all of his support within the Senate. Palpatine persuades Naboo&#39;s queen, Padm&amp;#65475;&amp;#65449; Amidala (Natalie Portman), to introduce a motion of no confidence in the Senate, and Valorum is removed from office. Palpatine is appointed in his place.&lt;/p&gt;

Fort Collins was founded as a military outpost of the United States Army in 1864. It succeeded a previous encampment, known as Camp Collins, on the Cache La Poudre River, near present-day Laporte. Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the region. Travelers crossing the county on the Overland Trail would camp there, but a flood destroyed the camp in June 1864. Afterward, the commander of the fort wrote to the commandant of Fort Laramie in southeast Wyoming, Colonel William O. Collins, suggesting that a site several miles further down the Poudre would make a good&lt;/p&gt;

The land area of the 33 islets aggregates to 2.4 sq km, less than one percent of the total area of the atoll. There is an airstrip, hotel (Vaiaku Langi Hotel), and administrative buildings, as well as homes, constructed both in the traditional manner, out of palm fronds, and more recently out of cement blocks. The most prominent building on Funafuti atoll is the Church of Tuvalu. Other sites of interest are the remains of United States aircraft that crashed on Funafuti during World War II, when the airstrip was used by the U.S. forces to defend the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands. The U.S. claimed Funafuti under the Guano Islands Act from the 1800s until a treaty of friendship was concluded in 1979, coming into effect in 1983.

It is the administrative capital of the South-East District as well as the sub-district of Gaborone. Locals often refer to the city as Gabs.
Gaborone is situated at 24&amp;#176;39&amp;#8242;29&amp;#8243;S 25&amp;#176;54&amp;#8242;44&amp;#8243;E&amp;#65279; / &amp;#65279;24.65806&amp;#176;S 25.91222&amp;#176;E&amp;#65279; / -24.65806; 25.91222 between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana, and 15&amp;#160;kilometres (9.3&amp;#160;mi) from the South African border. The city is served by the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport.
Evidence shows that there have been inhabitants along the Notwane River for centuries. In more recent history, Chief Kgosi Gaborone left the Magaliesberg to settle in the area around 1880, and called the settlement Moshaweng. The city was then called Gaberones by the early European settlers. Gaberones, derived from Gaborone&#39;s Village, was named after Chief Gaborone of the BaTlokwa, whose home village, now called Tlokweng, was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, Lucas is one of the American film industry&#39;s most financially successful independent directors/producers, with an estimated net worth of $3.0 billion as of 2009.
Lucas was born in Modesto, California, the son of Dorothy Lucas (n&amp;#233;e Bomberger) and George Lucas Sr. (1913&amp;#8211;1991), who owned a stationery store.
Lucas&#39; experiences growing up in the sleepy Central Valley town of Modesto and his early passion for cars and motor racing would eventually serve as inspiration for his Oscar-nominated low-budget phenomenon, American Graffiti. Long before Lucas became obsessed with film making, he wanted to be a race-car driver, and he spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages.

Formerly a municipality and then a city in its own right, since 1976 George Town has been part of the municipality of Penang Island, though the area formerly governed by the city council is still commonly referred to as a city, and is also known as Tanjung (&quot;The Cape&quot;) in Malay and &amp;#21932;&amp;#27835;&amp;#24066; (Qi&amp;#225;ozh&amp;#236; Sh&amp;#236;) in Chinese.
The inner city of George Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
George Town was founded in 1786 by Captain Francis Light, a trader for the British East India Company, as base for the company in the Malay States. He obtained the island of Penang from the Sultan of Kedah and built Fort Cornwallis on the north-eastern corner of the island. The fort became the nexus of a growing trading post and the island&#39;s population reached 12,000 by 1804.
The town was built on swampy land that had to be cleared of vegetation, levelled and filled. The original commercial town was laid out between Light Street, Beach Street (then running&lt;/p&gt;

The word Ghana means &quot;Warrior King&quot; and derives from the Ghana Empire.
Ghana was inhabited in pre-colonial times by a number of ancient predominantly Akan Kingdoms, including the Akwamu on the eastern coast, the inland Ashanti Empire and various Fante and non-Akan states, like the Ga and Ewe, along the coast and inland. Trade with European states flourished after contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century, and the British established a Crown colony, Gold Coast, in 1874.
The Gold Coast achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, becoming the first sub-Saharan African nation to do so and the name Ghana was chosen for the new nation to reflect the ancient Empire of Ghana, which once extended throughout much of west Africa.

The territory itself is a peninsula of 6.843&amp;#160;square kilometres (2.642&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) whose isthmus connects to the north with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the area and gives its name to the densely populated town, home to almost 30,000 Gibraltarians.
Gibraltar was captured by a joint Anglo-Dutch force in 1704 during the War of Spanish Succession and subsequently ceded to Britain by Spain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations as Spain asserts a claim to the territory and seeks its return. Gibraltarians resoundingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in referendums held in 1967 and 2002.
Gibraltar was for almost three centuries an important strategic base for the Royal Navy, which drove the local economy and provided employment for a large proportion of the local population. Nowadays, the economy is largely based on tourism, financial services and shipping.

When she names another planet, he destroys Alderaan anyway; seemingly of his own initiative without any authorization from the Emperor. Tarkin dies when Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star in the film&#39;s climax.
Tarkin also appears at the end of Revenge of the Sith, set 19 years earlier, watching the construction&lt;/p&gt;

Greenville was named after American Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene.
Greenville is located on the eastern bank of Lake Ferguson, an oxbow lake left from an old channel of the Mississippi River. Two floating casinos are located on the lake near the downtown area, with a third just west of the city near the Greenville Bridge. Chicago Mill and Lumber Co. operated a lumber mill on the lake .2 mile south of the casino levee parking lot; the mill specialized in making hardwood boxes until it closed. The Winterville Mounds Historic Site, with museum and picnic area, is located just north of the town at 2415 Highway 1 N; the Indian mounds were built by a tribe that predated the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian tribes.

Grenada is located northwest of Trinidad and Tobago, northeast of Venezuela, and southwest of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
Its size is 344&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;, with an estimated population of	110,000. Its capital is St. George&#39;s. The national bird of Grenada is the critically endangered Grenada Dove.
The recorded history of Grenada begins in 1498. At the time the indigenous Island Caribs (Kalinago) who lived there called it Camahogne. The Spaniards did not permanently settle on Camahogne. Later the English failed their first settlement attempts, but the French fought and conquered Grenada from the Caribs circa 1650. The French conquest resulted in the genocide of 17th century Caribs from present-day Grenada. Warfare also existed between the Caribs of present day Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines with the French invaders.
The French took control of Camahogne and named the new French colony La Grenade. La Grenade prospered as a wealthy French colony; its main export was sugar. The&lt;/p&gt;

It was so named by a 1902 Swedish surveyor who found old English try pots used to render seal oil at the site. It is the best harbour on the island, consisting of a bay (King Edward Cove) within a bay (Cumberland East Bay). The site is quite sheltered, provides a substantial area of flat land suitable for building on, and has a good supply of fresh water.
The settlement at Grytviken was established on November 16, 1904, by the Norwegian sea captain Carl Anton Larsen as a whaling station for his Compa&amp;#241;&amp;#237;a Argentina de Pesca (Argentine Fishing Company). It was phenomenally successful, with 195 whales taken in the first season alone. The whalers used every part of the animals - the blubber, meat, bones and viscera were cooked to extract the oil and the bones and meat were turned into fertilizer and fodder. Elephant seals were also hunted for their blubber. Around 300 men worked at the station during its heyday, operating during the southern summer from October to March. A few remained over the winter to maintain the boats and factory. Every few months a&lt;/p&gt;

Discovered by Europeans in 1498, Guyana has been struggled over for 500 years by the Spanish, French, Dutch, and British. It is the only state of the Commonwealth of Nations on mainland South America. Guyana is also a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which has its secretariat headquarters in Guyana&#39;s capital, Georgetown. Guyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 26 May 1966.
Historically, the region known as &quot;Guiana or Guayana&quot; was the large shield landmass north of the Amazon River and East of the Orinoco River. Five sub-regions were carved out of the landmass by colonial powers in the late 17th and early 18th century: Spanish Guiana (now eastern Venezuela), Portuguese Guiana (now northern Brazil), British Guiana (Guyana), Dutch Guiana (Suriname), and the present French overseas department of French Guiana.

Hamilton is located on the north side of Hamilton Harbour, and is Bermuda&#39;s main port. Although there is a parish of the same name, the city of Hamilton is in the parish of Pembroke. The City is named after Sir Henry Hamilton, governor from 1778 to 1794. The parish of Hamilton pre-dates it.
In spite of being the administrative capital of Bermuda, Hamilton only has a permanent population of approximately 969, although some estimates have it as high as 1,500. Hamilton is the only incorporated city in Bermuda, but actually is smaller than the historic town of St. George&#39;s. A more representative measure of Bermuda population tends to be by parish.
As the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly-developed international business economy; it is a financial exporter of financial services, primarily insurance, reinsurance, investment funds and special purpose vehicles (SPV). Finance and international business now constitute the largest sector of Bermuda&#39;s economy, and virtually all of this business takes place within&lt;/p&gt;

With a population of 54,842 people, it is the largest settlement in the county.
The name &quot;Hereford&quot; is said to come from the Anglo Saxon &quot;here&quot;, an army or formation of soldiers, and the &quot;ford&quot;, a place for crossing a river. If this is the origin it suggests that Hereford was a place where a body of armed men forded or crossed the Wye. The Welsh name for Hereford is Henffordd meaning old road and probably referring to the Roman Road and Roman settlement at neary Stretton alternatively the name, seldom used in &#39;Caerffawydd, meaning &quot;Beach Fortress&quot;.
Hereford Cathedral dates from 1079 and contains the Mappa Mundi, a medieval map of the world dating from the 13th century which was restored in the late 20th century. It also contains the world famous Chained Library.

He has had a successful career in theatre; he has been cast in many plays, while occasionally directing others.
Although McDiarmid has appeared mostly in theatrical productions, he has also accepted roles in theatrical films and TV movies. Worldwide, he is most famous for his role as Palpatine in both the original and prequel Star Wars trilogies.
McDiarmid was born in Carnoustie. He became a theatre aficionado when he was five years old, when his father took him to see an act by the name of Tommy Morgan in a theatre located in Dundee. In 2004 he stated, &quot;It sort of fascinated me, and it also scared me. All those lights, all that make-up. I said to myself, &#39;I don&#39;t know what this is, but I want it.&#39;&quot; However, fearing his father&#39;s disapproval, McDiarmid attended the University of St Andrews, where he received an M.A. in psychology. Soon after, he decided to pursue a career in the theatre instead, and took acting training courses at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. In 1968,&lt;/p&gt;

It is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second-most populous country with over 1.18 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the west, and the Bay of Bengal on the east, India has a coastline of 7,517&amp;#160;kilometres (4,700&amp;#160;mi). It is bordered by Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Burma to the east. India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.
Home to the Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four major religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated here, while Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam arrived in the first millennium CE and shaped the region&#39;s diverse culture. Gradually annexed by the British East India Company from the early eighteenth century and colonised by the United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;

The island has been inhabited since before 6500 BC. It began to be influenced by Gaelic culture in the 400s AD and the Manx language, a branch of the Gaelic languages, gradually emerged. In the 800s, the Norse began to settle there. A Norse-Gaelic culture emerged and the island came under Norse control. In 1266 the island became part of Scotland.

The 1997 release of a New Hope reinserted previously omitted scenes of Jabba&amp;#8212;supplanting CGI images on the original &quot;human&quot; actor to fit with his depiction in later films. His first cinematic introduction was in the third film Return of the Jedi (1983) as an odious mass of greasy, insect-ridden flesh with a sadistic love of torture. Jabba served as a minor antagonist throughout the initial series, where he was shown abusing his many cohorts, putting a bounty on Solo&#39;s head, attempting to kill Luke Skywalker, and enslaving Princess Leia Organa who eventually kills him.
In The Phantom Menace, Jabba can be seen starting off the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace where Anakin Skywalker beat Sebulba and all of the other contestants. In Return of the Jedi Jabba was shown as a large, slug-like alien; his appearance also somewhat resembles that of crossing between a toad and the Cheshire Cat.

It is situated in the Caribbean Sea, about 145&amp;#160;kilometres (90&amp;#160;mi) south of Cuba, and 190&amp;#160;kilometres (120&amp;#160;mi) west of Hispaniola, the island harboring the nation-states Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its indigenous Arawakan-speaking Ta&amp;#237;no inhabitants named the island Xaymaca, meaning the &quot;Land of Wood and Water&quot;, or the &quot;Land of Springs&quot;.
Once a Spanish possession known as Santiago, in 1655 it became the English, and later the British, colony known as &quot;Jamaica&quot;. With 2.8 million people, it is the third most populous anglophone country in the Americas, after the United States and Canada. It remains a Commonwealth realm with Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State. Kingston is the largest city in Jamaica and the country&#39;s capital.
The Arawak and Taino indigenous people originating from South America settled on the island between 4000 and 1000 BC. When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1494 there were over 200 villages ruled by caciques (chiefs of villages). The south coast of Jamaica was the most populated,&lt;/p&gt;

James Earl Jones was born in Arkabutla, Mississippi, the son of Ruth (n&amp;#233;e Connolly), a teacher and maid, and Robert Earl Jones (1910&amp;#8211;2006), an actor, boxer, butler, and chauffeur who left the family shortly after James Earl&#39;s birth.

Jones was raised by his maternal grandparents, farmers Maggie and John Henry Connolly, and is of African, Irish, Choctaw and Cherokee descent.
He moved to his maternal grandparents&#39; farm in Jackson, Michigan at the age of five, but the adoption was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak aloud.

Jar Jar Binks first appears in The Phantom Menace as a bumbling Gungan from the planet Naboo.

Jar-Jar later appears in the film&#39;s climactic battle scene, where he joins his fellow Gungans in defeating the evil Trade Federation. For his heroics, he is made a general in the Gungan army, and Padm&amp;#233; gives him a ceremonial medal.

The city is divided into five boroughs that oversee local planning: Kampala Central, Kawempe Division, Makindye Division, Nakawa Division and Lubaga Division. The city is coterminous with Kampala District.
Mutesa I, the Kabaka (king) of Buganda, had chosen the area that was to become Kampala as one of his favorite hunting grounds. The area was made up of numerous rolling hills and lush wetlands. It was an ideal breeding ground for various game, particularly a species of antelope, the Impala (Aepyceros melampus). The origin of the word impala is likely from the Zulu language in South Africa.
The city grew as the capital of the Buganda kingdom, from which several buildings survive, including the Kasubi Tombs (built in 1881), the Buganda Parliament, the Buganda Court of Justice and the Naggalabi Buddo Coronation Site. Severely damaged in the Uganda-Tanzania War, the city has since then been rebuilt with constructions of new buildings including hotels, banks, shopping malls, educational institutions, hospitals and improvement of war torn buildings and infrastructure. Traditionally, Kampala was a city of seven hills, but over time it&lt;/p&gt;

Significant portions of Kenley lie within the London Green Belt. In particular, the south of Kenley is dominated by the open green spaces of Kenley Common and Kenley Aerodrome.
A comprehensive history of Kenley is found in the Bourne Society&#39;s &#39;Kenley Village History&#39;.
For centuries, Kenley was part of Coulsdon Manor which covered the whole area now known as Coulsdon, Old Coulsdon, Purley and Kenley. As with most of this area, Kenley was primarily farm land, with a few big houses and their estates.
The official opening of the railway on 4 August 1856 transformed Kenley. The new railway prompted urban development. By the end of the Victorian era, Kenley had assumed its own identity. Magnificent gentlemen&#39;s houses in substantial grounds were constructed during the 1860s. These houses gave Kenley its distinctive appearance on its western hillside. More modest housing and shops were built along the Godstone Road in the 1880s. Finally, the&lt;/p&gt;

Kenya has numerous wildlife reserves, containing thousands of animal species. The capital city is Nairobi. Kenya&#39;s population of nearly 38 million is diverse - with more than 40 different cultures represented.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Ki-Adi-Mundi is a fictional character from the Star Wars universe. He was portrayed by actor Silas Carson throughout the Star Wars prequel trilogy.
Ki-Adi-Mundi is a wise Jedi Knight and Jedi Council member at the time of the Clone Wars. Notably, he is invited into the Council after the fall of Master Micah Giiett during the Yinchorri conflict, at the urging of Master Mace Windu who was not keen on the other candidate, Qui-Gon Jinn. Hailing from the planet Cerea, he survived the Battle of Geonosis in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, fighting alongside other such luminaries as Windu and Yoda. He contributed in the end by rescuing other Jedi, like Kit Fisto, by grabbing them and putting them on board while deflecting blaster shots with Windu.
The comic books series Star Wars: Republic establishes that Ki-Adi was once the apprentice of the enigmatic Jedi Master known as The Dark Woman, but he later came under the tutelage of Yoda. In the Republic story &quot;Hate and Fear&quot;, Ki-Adi-Mundi takes over as Anakin Skywalker&#39;s surrogate master when Obi-Wan Kenobi is presumed dead after the Battle of Jabiim.
In an episode of Star Wars: Clone Wars, Ki-Adi-Mundi is part of a Jedi strike&lt;/p&gt;

The population as of the 2001 census was 2,611,300. However, higher numbers have been cited in the press.
Kiev is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural centre of Eastern Europe. It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions and world-famous historical landmarks. The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of public transport, including the Kiev Metro. Kiev was classified as a Beta world city- as of 2004.
The name Kiev is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of four legendary founders of the city (brothers Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv, and sister Lybid). During its history, Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity. The city may have been founded in the 5th century as a trading post, perhaps part of the land of the early Slavs. It gradually acquired eminence as the centre of the East Slavic civilization,&lt;/p&gt;

The main residence and offices of the President of Rwanda are located in the city, as are the government ministries. The city is coterminous with the province of Kigali City, which was enlarged in January 2006 as part of local government reorganisation in the country. The city&#39;s urban area covers about 70% of the municipal boundaries.
Kigali was founded in 1907 under German colonial rule, but did not become the capital until Rwandan independence in 1962. The traditional capital was the seat of the mwami (king) in Nyanza, while the colonial seat of power was in Butare, then known as Astrida. Butare was initially the leading contender to be the capital of the new independent nation, but Kigali was chosen because of its more central location. Since then the city has grown very quickly and is now the major political, economic and cultural centre of Rwanda.
Beginning on April 6, 1994, Kigali was the scene of the Rwandan Genocide &amp;#8212; the&lt;/p&gt;

In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.
The local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the &quot;Corporate Area&quot; refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston ends at East Street, West Street and North Street.

France started a settlement here shortly after 1722.
The Botanical garden, conceived in 1765, is the oldest in the Western hemisphere. Capt William Bligh made famous from the Mutiny on the Bounty, brought seeds of the Breadfruit tree here for planting, ca 1793.
Kingstown is overlooked by Fort Charlotte on Berkshire Hill, just west of town. Over 600 feet above the bay, it is the major early 19th century fortification on Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. A redoubt accessed by a viaduct; its guns point inland. The British garrison were to use it for holding out against the French while the Royal Navy brought reinforcements from other islands.

It is composed of 32 atolls and one raised coral island, dispersed over 3,500,000 square kilometres, (1,351,000&amp;#160;square&amp;#160;miles) straddling the equator, and bordering the International Date Line to the east. The name Kiribati is the local pronunciation of &quot;Gilberts&quot;, derived from the main island chain, the Gilbert Islands. Kiribati became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the IMF and the World Bank, and became a full member of the United Nations in 1999.
Kiribati was named Gilbert Islands after the British Captain Thomas Gilbert, who sighted the islands in 1788. The current name, Kiribati, is an adaptation of &quot;Gilberts&quot;, from the former European name the &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot;. Although the indigenous Gilbertese language name for the Gilbert Islands proper is Tungaru, the new state chose the name &quot;Kiribati&quot;, the Gilbertese rendition of &quot;Gilberts&quot;, as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of islands which were never considered&lt;/p&gt;

The Parliament of Sri Lanka has been based there since the formal inauguration of its new building on 29 April 1982.
The village of Darugama lay at the confluence of two streams, the Diyawanna Oya and the Kolonnawa Oya. As Darugama was a naturally secure place, it was not easy for enemies to enter it. Here, in the 13th century, a chieftain named Nissanka Alagakkonara built a fortress called Kotte (meaning &#39;Fortress&#39;) against invasion from the Jaffna Kingdom of Arya Chakaravarthi.
Alagakkonara is mentioned by Ibn Batuta as ruling in Kurunegala, but other sources indicate that he was the Bandara (Guardian) of Raigama Korale (county) in the modern Kalutara District. Arya Chakravarthy&#39;s army was held by Alagakkonara in front of Kotte, while he defeated the enemy&#39;s invasion fleet at Panadura to the south-west.
Kotte was a jala durgha (water fortress), in the shape of a triangle,&lt;/p&gt;

Landlocked and mountainous, it is bordered by Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the west, Tajikistan to the southwest and People&#39;s Republic of China to the east. Its capital and largest city is Bishkek.
The ethnonym &quot;Kyrgyz&quot;, after which the country is named, is thought to originally mean &quot;forty tribes&quot;, presumably referring to the epic hero Manas who, as legend has it, unified forty tribes against the Khitans. The 40-ray sun on the flag of Kyrgyzstan symbolizes the forty tribes of Manas. It might also refer to &amp;#8220;red&amp;#8221;, the colour of the &amp;#8220;south country&amp;#8221; of the original Turkic nations.
The April 2010 riots caused the ex-president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, to flee the country.
The original meaning of the word Kyrgyz has many interpretations. One variant alleges that &quot;kyrgyz&quot; originally meant &amp;#8220;red&amp;#8221;. This colour also marked the &amp;#8220;south country&amp;#8221; of original Turkic nations.

He also appears frequently in the Star Wars &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; of novels, comic books and video games, including a series of novels in which he is the protagonist.
Billy Dee Williams considered the role of Calrissian to be the turning point in his career, as he appeared in a box office smash.
Lando Calrissian first appears in The Empire Strikes Back, in which Darth Vader coerces Lando into giving his old friend Han Solo over to the bounty hunter Boba Fett. In the ensuing evacuation of Cloud City, he helps Chewbacca, Princess Leia Organa, R2-D2 and C-3PO escape. He assists Leia in rescuing the maimed Luke Skywalker from the underside of Cloud City. He then joins the Rebel Alliance.
In Return of the Jedi, Calrissian goes undercover to help Luke Skywalker rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt. He is named a General for his efforts during the battle of Taanab. He then takes the pilot chair in the Millennium Falcon (with an entirely new crew onboard) and leads the second attack into the Death Star. Wedge&lt;/p&gt;

She is perhaps best known for her role as Zam Wesell in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002) and for playing Carly Bishop in the Australian film Looking For Alibrandi (2000).
Leeanna Walsman was born in Sydney, Australia on the 15th of October, 1980, to father Bob and mother Elaine. She is the youngest of their children, and has an older brother, David. Though much about her is not widely known, it is widely publicised that she left school after completing her School Certificate (grade 10) to pursue a career in acting. It is around this time, in 1995 and 1996 that she attended the Australian Theatre for Young People (ATYP) and a number of National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) workshops.
&quot;She was always singing and dancing for the family,&quot; states her brother, regarding his sister&#39;s childhood, &quot;She was this spunky kid with this natural ability to perform. There&#39;s this photo of the two of us when we were young and I&#39;m standing there, a skinny-legged nerd, and Leeanna, who must have been about four, has got her arms crossed confidently. She looks like a bouncer! Even then she could hold herself&lt;/p&gt;

It is just over 30,000&amp;#160;km (11,583&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) in size with an estimated population of almost 1,800,000. Its capital and largest city is Maseru. Lesotho is the southernmost landlocked country in the world. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The name &quot;Lesotho&quot; translates roughly into &quot;the land of the people who speak Sesotho&quot;. About 40% of the population live below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day.
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were Khoisan hunter-gatherers. They were largely replaced by Wasja-speaking tribes during Bantu migrations. The Sotho-Tswana people colonized the general region of South Africa between the 3rd and 11th centuries.
The present Lesotho (then called Basutoland) emerged as a single polity under the Great King Moshoeshoe I in 1822. Son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bakoteli lineage, Moshoeshoe formed his own clan and became a chief around 1804.

It borders Walthamstow to the northwest, Wanstead (in the London Borough of Redbridge) to the north, Leyton to the south, and Forest Gate (in the London Borough of Newham) to the east.
The main thoroughfare in Leytonstone, High Road Leytonstone, which runs the length of Leytonstone to Stratford is an ancient pathway dating to pre-Roman times. Roman archaeological features have been found in the area.
The name Leytonstone&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; in early documents Leyton-Atte-Stone&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; may derive from the large stone standing at the junction of Hollybush Hill and New Wanstead; in the 18th-century an obelisk was mounted on top of it, and it has been claimed that it is the remains of a Roman milestone.
Two of the obelisk&#39;s inscriptions are still just legible: others are not.
It has been claimed that High Road Leytonstone is a prehistoric pathway dating from before the Romans built a road along the same route to London. However Roman roads have since been found&lt;/p&gt;

Liberia&#39;s capital is Monrovia. Liberia has a hot equatorial climate with most rainfall arriving in summer with harsh harmattan winds in the dry season. Liberia&#39;s populated Pepper Coast is composed of mostly mangrove forests while the sparsely populated inland is forested, later opening to a plateau of drier grasslands.
The history of Liberia is unique among African nations because of its relationship with the United States. It is one of the few countries in Africa, and the only country in West Africa, without roots in the European Scramble for Africa. It was founded and colonized by freed American slaves with the help of a private organization called the American Colonization Society in 1821-1822, on the premise that former American slaves would have greater freedom and equality there.

London is a leading global city being one of the world&#39;s largest financial centres and has the largest city GDP in Europe. Central London is home to the headquarters of most of the UK&#39;s top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and more than 100 of Europe&#39;s 500 largest.

Mace Windu is one of the earliest named and created characters in Star Wars history, being the narrator of the original 1973 drafts of the original Star Wars film (later named Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope). Through the process of redrafting and copyediting, his character was removed from the original film and its two successors, but he was reintroduced in 1994 when series creator George Lucas began writing the prequel trilogy.
When Lucas offered Samuel L. Jackson the role of Mace Windu, Jackson signed on, but with certain stipulations on the portrayal of his character. Aware that the climax of the prequel trilogy would eventually call for Mace Windu&#39;s death, one of the conditions was that his character die in a spectacular fashion, rather than ingloriously be killed off. 
Also, according to an interview on The Late Show with David Letterman on May 13, 2005, Windu&#39;s purple lightsaber was a personal request from Jackson to Lucas as a quid pro quo for appearing in the films, as well as a way of making the character unique and easily distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;

Manchester is situated in the south-central part of North West England, fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south and the Pennines to the north and east. The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian vicus associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium, which was established c. AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. Historically, most of the city was a part of Lancashire, although areas south of the River Mersey were in Cheshire.

Manly is located 17 kilometres north-east of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre of the local government area of Manly Council, in the Northern Beaches region.
Manly was named by Capt. Arthur Phillip for the indigenous people living there, &quot;their confidence and manly behaviour made me give the name of Manly Cove to this place&quot;. These men were of the Kay-ye-my clan (of the Guringai people). While scouting for fresh water in the area, Phillip encountered members of the clan, and after a misunderstanding he was speared in the shoulder by one of the clan; to his lasting credit, the progressively-minded Phillip ordered his men not to retaliate.
Manly had been envisaged as a seaside resort by Henry Gilbert Smith in the 1850s. In 1853 Smith acquired two large parcels of land (which had been granted to John Thompson in 1842 and John Crane Parker in 1837).
Initially Smith had chartered a paddle steamer to Manly and other vessels visited on an ad hoc &amp;#8220;excursion&amp;#8221; basis. Smith built a wharf in 1855 and eventually acquired an interest in steamers himself and soon more regular&lt;/p&gt;

Although it is in Leicestershire, its surrounding villages are half in Leicestershire and half in Northamptonshire. The town was formerly at a cross roads for both road and rail, however the A6 now bypasses the town to the east and the A14 which carries east-west traffic is 6&amp;#160;miles (9.7&amp;#160;km) to the south. The town is served by East Midlands Trains with direct services to Nottingham, Derby and St Pancras International. Rail services to Rugby and Peterborough ended in 1966.
The centre of the town is dominated by the steeple of St Dionysius Parish Church which rises direct from the street, as there is no church yard. It was constructed in grey stone in 1300 with the church itself a later building of about 1470. Next to the church stands the Old Grammar School, a small timber building dating from 1614. The ground floor is open, creating a covered market area and there is a single room on the first floor. It has become a symbol of the town. The nearby square is largely pedestrianised and&lt;/p&gt;

This nation of roughly 62,000 people is located north of Nauru and Kiribati, east of the Federated States of Micronesia, and south of the U.S. territory of Wake Island, to which it lays claim. In 1986 independence was attained under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.
Although the Marshall Islands were settled by Micronesians in the 2nd millennium BC, little is known of their early history. People traveled by canoe between islands using traditional stick charts.
Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar was the first European to see the islands in 1526, but they remained virtually unvisited by Europeans until the arrival of British Captain John Charles Marshall in 1788. The islands were named after him in the British maps. However, they were claimed under the Spanish sovereignty as part of the Spanish Oceania. In 1874 the Spanish sovereignty was recognized by the international community. They were sold to Germany&lt;/p&gt;

Marylebone is in an area of London that can be roughly defined as the area bounded by Oxford Street to the south, Marylebone Road to the north, Edgware Road to the west and Great Portland Street to the east . Occasionally, this area is designated as &quot;Marylebone Village&quot;. A broader definition of Marylebone is then used, which encompasses Regent&#39;s Park, Baker Street and the area immediately north of Marylebone Road, containing Marylebone Station, the original site of the Marylebone Cricket Club at Dorset Square, and the neighbourhood known as Lisson Grove to the border with St John&#39;s Wood. The west side of the Fitzrovia area up to Cleveland Street was also previously considered to be part of Marylebone.
Today the area is mostly residential, with many medical and dental offices in its central area.

He was portrayed by Jerome Blake in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, David Bowers in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and by both Blake and Bowers in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Principal photography for the final film was conducted in Sydney Australia, and the character&#39;s scenes were shot with Bowers. Additional scenes were filmed in England, so rather than fly Bowers to England, Lucas had Blake reprise the role. The character&#39;s appearance was done with make-up rather than CGI effects.
An action figure was made of the film version of the character, who also appears in the novelizations of the films.
In The Phantom Menace, he serves as vice-chair of the Galactic Senate, assisting Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum.

The city was established as a police camp and assigned as the capital after the country became a British protectorate in 1869. When the country achieved independence in 1966, Maseru retained its status as capital. The name of the city is a Sesotho word meaning &quot;place of the red sandstone&quot;.
Maseru was founded by the British as a small police camp in 1869, following the conclusion of the Free State-Basotho Wars when Basutoland became a British protectorate. Maseru is located at the edge of the &quot;conquered territories&quot; relinquished to the Orange Free State (now the Free State province of South Africa) as part of the peace terms. It was located 24&amp;#160;kilometres (15&amp;#160;mi) west of Basotho King Moshoeshoe I&#39;s stronghold of Thaba Bosiu, the previous de facto capital. A bustling market town soon grew around the area.
Maseru initially functioned as the state&#39;s administrative capital between 1869 and 1871, before administration of Basutoland was transferred to the Cape Colony.&lt;/p&gt;

Massillon, along with neighboring Canton, are principal cities of the Canton&amp;#8211;Massillon Metropolitan Statistical Area. The metropolitan area includes all of Stark and Carroll counties.
The Friendly Association for Mutual Interests founded Massillon, then called Kendal, on a 2,000-acre (8.1&amp;#160;km) estate in response to Robert Owen&#39;s success in New Harmony, Indiana to create a utopian society. The group of approximately 150 people, consisting of farmers, mill workers, and mechanics from the surrounding area, abandoned their communitarian lifestyle. The town center was eventually located along the banks of the Tuscarawas River and the Ohio and Erie Canal. Massillon was named after Jean Baptiste Massillon, a French Catholic bishop.
Early in the 20th Century, Massillon was home to a brass era automobile maker, Forest City Motor Car Company; despite its name, the Jewel did not shine, and the company went under.
Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) provides bus service between Massillon and nearby Canton.

The name Mexborough combines the Old English suffix burh meaning a fortified place with an Old English or Old Norse personal name, which may be Meke, Muik, Meoc, or Mjukr.
Mexborough is located at the north eastern end of a dyke known as the Roman Ridge that is thought to have been constructed either by the Brigantian tribes in the 1st century AD, perhaps as a defence against the Roman invasion of Britain, or after the 5th century to defend the British kingdom of Elmet from the Angles.
The earliest known written reference to Mexborough is found in the Domesday Book of 1086 (Mechesburg), which states that prior to the Norman conquest of England the area had been controlled by the Saxon lords Wulfheah and Ulfkil. Following the conquest the area fell under the control of the Norman Baron Roger de Busli. The remains of an earthwork in Castle Park are though to have been a motte and bailey castle in the constructed in the 11th century shortly after the conquest.

Its Georgian era capital city of Plymouth was destroyed and two-thirds of the island&#39;s population were forced to flee abroad by an eruption of the previously dormant Soufriere Hills volcano that began on July 18, 1995. The eruption continues today on a much reduced scale, the damage being confined to the areas around Plymouth including its docking facilities and the former W.H. Bramble Airport.

Its nearest neighbour is Banaba Island in Kiribati, 300&amp;#160;km to the east. Nauru is the world&#39;s smallest island nation, covering just 21 square kilometres (8.1 square miles).
Settled by Micronesian and Polynesian people, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific, and after the war ended, it entered into trusteeship again. Nauru was declared independent in 1968.
Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Nauru was a &quot;rentier state&quot;. Nauru is a phosphate rock island, with deposits close to the surface, which allow for simple strip mining operations. This island was a major exporter of phosphate starting in 1907, when the Pacific Phosphate Company began mining there, through the formation of the British Phosphate&lt;/p&gt;

New Delhi is one of the nine districts of Delhi. The foundation of the city was laid on December 15, 1911, and was planned by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, leading 20th century British architects. Inaugurated on February 13, 1931 by Viceroy, Lord Irwin, the city is known for its wide, tree-lined boulevards and is home to numerous national institutions and landmarks. The total area of the city is 42.7 km. 
New Delhi was laid out to the south of the Old City which was constructed by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. However, New Delhi overlays the site of seven ancient cities and hence includes many historic monuments like the Jantar Mantar and the Lodhi Gardens.
Calcutta was the capital of India until December 1911 during the British Raj. However, Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient and medieval India, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1799 to 1849. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made&lt;/p&gt;

The indigenous M&amp;#257;ori language name for New Zealand is Aotearoa, commonly translated as The Land of the Long White Cloud. The Realm of New Zealand also includes the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing but in free association); Tokelau; and the Ross Dependency (New Zealand&#39;s territorial claim in Antarctica).
New Zealand is notable for its geographic isolation: it is situated about 2,000&amp;#160;km (1250 miles) southeast of Australia across the Tasman Sea, and its closest neighbours to the north are New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga. During its long isolation New Zealand developed a distinctive fauna dominated by birds, a number of which became extinct after the arrival of humans and the mammals they introduced.
The majority of New Zealand&#39;s population is of European descent; the indigenous M&amp;#257;ori are the largest minority. Asians and non-M&amp;#257;ori Polynesians are also significant minority groups, especially in urban areas. The most commonly spoken language is English.

The area was inhabited by the Ohlone people for thousands of years before Spanish settlers displaced them in the 18th and 19th centuries. Spain expanded the Viceroyalty of New Spain and colonized Alta California to stop the advancement of Russia from Alaska. Much of the land that was to become Oakland was held by the Peralta family under the Rancho San Antonio (Peralta) land grant.

It is also the setting for the Showtime series The United States of Tara.
The city traces its roots back to 1905, with the arrival of its founder, William B. Strang Jr., who plotted subdivisions along a military roadway on 600 acres (2.4&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;) he purchased that are now part of the old downtown area. One of those subdivisions was named Overland Park, and was the site for the first airplane flight west of the Mississippi with shows by the Wright brothers, sponsored by Strang, on December 24, 1909.

She first appeared on film in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), as the young queen of the planet Naboo. In subsequent prequel trilogy films, Padm&amp;#233; represents Naboo in the Galactic Senate. She is featured in the animated miniseries Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003&amp;#8211;2005), Star Wars: The Clone Wars and in Star Wars literature.

It has a 1,046-kilometre (650&amp;#160;mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by Afghanistan and Iran in the west, India in the east and China in the far northeast. Tajikistan also lies very close to Pakistan but is separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor. Thus, it occupies a crossroads position between South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. The region forming modern Pakistan was at the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and then later was the recipient of Vedic, Persian, Indo-Greek, Turco-Mongol, Islamic and Sikh cultures. The area has witnessed invasions and/or settlements by the Indo-Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Turks, Afghans, Mongols and the British.
While the Indian independence movement demanded an independent India, the Pakistan Movement (led by Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah of the Muslim League) sought independent states for the majority Muslim populations of the eastern and western regions of British India as well. The British granted independence and also the creation of one Muslim majority state of Pakistan that&lt;/p&gt;

Palpatine first appeared as the Emperor of the Galactic Empire in the 1980 film Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back as an aged, pale-faced figure who wears dark robes, and later shown to walk with the aid of a twisted wooden cane.
Palpatine rises from Senator to Emperor in the prequel trilogy, in which he appears to be a middle-aged politician of the Republic who gains power through deception and treachery. As the Senator of Naboo and later the Supreme Chancellor, he behaves like a well-intentioned and loyal public servant. Although Palpatine is a well-respected statesman, underneath his affable public persona lurks his true identity: Darth Sidious, a Dark Lord of the Sith. As both Palpatine and Sidious, he sets into motion events &amp;#8212; namely the Clone Wars &amp;#8212; which ultimately destroy the Jedi Knights and severely weaken the Galactic Senate, thereby ushering in a new totalitarian order.
The character has since become a symbol of evil and sinister deception in popular culture. Palpatine was&lt;/p&gt;

Mayhew was born in Barnes, London Barnes, London, England. Before getting into acting, Mayhew worked as a porter at London&#39;s King&#39;s College Hospital.
He received his first acting job in 1977 when the producers of the movie Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger discovered Mayhew from a photograph in a newspaper article about men with large feet, and they cast him in the role of the minotaur.
When casting roles for his first Star Wars film, producer George Lucas needed a tall actor who could fit the role for the beastly Chewbacca. He originally had in mind 6&amp;#160;ft 6&amp;#160;in bodybuilder David Prowse, but Prowse was instead cast to play the role of Darth Vader. This led Lucas on a search which turned up Mayhew, who says that all he had to do to be cast in the role of Chewbacca was stand up. He reprised his signature role during Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, which was released in theatres on his birthday in 2005.

Brown was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After majoring in dramatics at Stanford University where he was a Brother of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, Brown played some of his earliest stage roles as part of New York&#39;s Group Theater. When it folded, he and other Group Theatre veterans headed to Hollywood, where Brown worked in motion pictures and helped found the fabled Actors&#39; Laboratory.
His association with the Lab came back to haunt him later in the decade, when its members fell under the scrutiny of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Although he was not a communist, Brown was blacklisted in 1952, and was eventually compelled to relocate with his family to England between 1953 and 1993.
Overseas he was able to resume acting on stage, TV and films; he also directed for the stage and TV. He was best known for his role as Luke Skywalker&#39;s uncle, Owen Lars, in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977).
He returned to the United States in the 1990s and in later years made the rounds of autograph shows.
Phil Brown died of pneumonia on February 9, 2006 at the age of 89.&lt;/p&gt;

It is bounded on the east by the Philippine Sea. An archipelago comprising 7,107 islands, the Philippines is categorized broadly into three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city is Manila.
With an estimated population of about 92&amp;#160;million people, the Philippines is the world&#39;s 12th most populous country. It is estimated that there are an additional 11&amp;#160;million overseas Filipinos worldwide. Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. Its tropical climate sustains one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world.
In prehistoric times, Negritos became some of the archipelago&#39;s earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples who brought with them&lt;/p&gt;

The islands are a British overseas territory (formerly a British colony), the last remaining in the Pacific. The four islands &amp;#8211; named Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno &amp;#8211; are spread over several hundred miles of ocean and have a total area of about 18&amp;#160;square miles (47&amp;#160;km). Only Pitcairn, the second largest and measuring about 2 miles across, is inhabited.
The islands are best known as home of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This story is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders. With only 50 inhabitants (from nine families), Pitcairn is also notable for being the least populated and most remote jurisdiction in the world (although it is not a sovereign nation). The United Nations Committee on Decolonisation includes the Pitcairn Islands on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.

It is built between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west, where they join Plymouth Sound. Since 1967 the City of Plymouth has included the suburbs of Plympton and Plymstock, which are on the east side of the River Plym.
Plymouth&#39;s history goes back to the Bronze Age, when its first settlement grew at Mount Batten. This settlement continued to grow as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until the more prosperous village of Sutton, the current Plymouth, surpassed it. In 1620 the Pilgrim Fathers left Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony &amp;#8211; the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646.
Throughout the Industrial Revolution Plymouth grew as a major shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas and the construction of ships for the Royal Navy. The county boroughs of Plymouth and Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were&lt;/p&gt;

The city is located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the southeastern coast of the island of New Guinea.
The area on which the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. It was first sighted by a European in 1873 by Captain John Moresby. It was named in honour of his father Admiral Sir Fairfax Moresby.
According to a survey of world cities by the Intelligence Unit of The Economist, Port Moresby is one of the world&#39;s least livable cities (ranks 137 of 140 cities rated).
Although it is surrounded by Central Province, where Port Moresby is also the capital, it is technically not a part of that province, and forms the National Capital District.
The Motuan people of the area now known as Port Moresby traded their pots for sago, other food and canoe logs, sailing from Hanuabada and other villages built on stilts above the waters of the bay. They also intermarried with the Gulf people and created strong family and trade links.

This suggests a 2007 population of about 40,000 or around 65% of the province&#39;s population. Port Vila is the economic and commercial centre of Vanuatu.
The area occupied by Port Vila has been inhabited by Melanesian people for thousands of years. In 1606, the first Europeans arrived at the island, led by Pedro Fern&amp;#225;ndez de Quir&amp;#243;s and Luis V&amp;#225;ez de Torres. In the 19th century, French settlers established the municipality of Franceville, which declared independence in 1889 and became the first self-governing nation to practice universal suffrage without distinction of sex or race. Although the population at the time consisted of about 500 native islanders and less than 50 whites, only the latter were permitted to hold office. One of the elected presidents was a U.S. citizen by birth, R.D. Polk.

In Star Wars fiction, Qui-Gon is best known as the mentor of the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as well as the one who discovers Anakin Skywalker (who later becomes Darth Vader).
Qui-Gon is introduced in Episode I as a wise and powerful Jedi Master and the teacher of the 25-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unlike other more conservative Jedi, he values living in the moment as the best way to embrace the Force. While other Jedi respect him, they are frequently puzzled by his unorthodox beliefs, and ultimately deny him a seat on the Jedi Council. Obi-Wan remarks that Qui-Gon has been in conflict with the Council several times in the past.
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones reveals that he was trained in the ways of the Jedi by Count Dooku. In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Jedi Master Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that Qui-Gon&#39;s spirit has learned the secret of becoming one with the Force, which he teaches to both Yoda&lt;/p&gt;

The central district of Roseau is tightly packed with small and large houses and even larger modern concrete structures. There is little green or open space situated within the city, and this is even more so today, as many of the courtyards which was once commonplace within the city are giving way to office space.

Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of three living members of the East Slavic languages. Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onwards. The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.
Russian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without, the so-called soft and hard sounds. This distinction is found between pairs of almost all consonants and is one of the most distinguishing features of the language. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels, which is somewhat similar to that of English. Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically though, according to the Russian Language Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional acute accent (&amp;#1079;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1082; &amp;#1091;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1103;) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark stress (such as to&lt;/p&gt;

Although close to the equator, the country has a cool temperate climate due to its high elevation. The terrain consists mostly of grassy uplands and gently rolling hills. Abundant wildlife, including rare mountain gorillas, have resulted in tourism becoming one of the biggest sectors of the country&#39;s economy.
Rwanda has received considerable international attention due to its 1994 genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed. Since then the country has made a recovery and is now considered as a model for developing countries. In 2009 a CNN report labeled Rwanda as Africa&#39;s biggest success story, having achieved stability, economic growth (average income has tripled in the past ten years) and international integration.

It is the smallest sovereign nation in the Americas, in both area and population.
The capital city and headquarters of government for the federated state is Basseterre on the larger island of Saint Kitts. The smaller state of Nevis lies about 2 miles (3&amp;#160;km) southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called &quot;The Narrows&quot;.
Historically, the British dependency of Anguilla was also a part of this union, which was then known collectively as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. Saint Kitts and Nevis are geographically part of the Leeward Islands. To the north-northwest lie the islands of Saint Eustatius, Saba, Saint Barth&amp;#233;lemy, and Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten. To the east and northeast are Antigua and Barbuda, and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of Redonda, and the island of Montserrat, which currently has an active volcano (see Soufri&amp;#232;re Hills).
Saint Kitts and Nevis were amongst the first islands in the Caribbean to be settled by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first British&lt;/p&gt;

Saint Lucia was founded in 1886 by Sir Arthur Sidders when he set sail from the port of Bristol, England. Part of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of 620&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; (238&amp;#160;mi&amp;#178;) and has an estimated population of 160,000. Its capital is Castries. The island nation has been the home of two Nobel laureates, Arthur Lewis and Derek Walcott. It is the nation with the second most such honorees per capita after Faroe Islands.
One of the Windward Islands, it was named for Saint Lucy of Syracuse by the French, the first European colonizers. They signed a treaty with the native Carib peoples in 1660. Great Britain took control of the island from 1663 to 1667; in ensuing years, it was at war with France 14 times and rule of the island changed frequently. In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the&lt;/p&gt;

Its 389-square-kilometre (150&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) territory consists of the main island of Saint Vincent and the northern two-thirds of the Grenadines, which are a chain of smaller islands stretching south from Saint Vincent to Grenada.
To the north of St. Vincent lies St. Lucia, to the east Barbados, and to the south Grenada. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has an estimated population of 120,000 and the capital is Kingstown. The country has a French and British colonial history and is now part of the Commonwealth of Nations and CARICOM.
The island now known as Saint Vincent was originally named &quot;Hairouna&quot; by the Carib Indians. Carib Indians aggressively prevented European settlement on St. Vincent until the 18th century. At that time, formerly enslaved Africans, who had either been shipwrecked or who had escaped from Barbados, St. Lucia and Grenada and sought refuge in mainland St. Vincent, intermarried with the Caribs and became known as Garifuna or Black Caribs.
Beginning in 1719, French settlers gained control of the island and&lt;/p&gt;

It became independent from New Zealand in 1962. The two main islands of Samoa are Upolu and one of the biggest islands in Polynesia Savai&#39;i. The capital city Apia and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.
Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976. The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, was called Navigators Islands by European explorers before the 20th century because of the Samoans&#39; seafaring skills.
The Samoans originated from Austronesian predecessors during the terminal eastward Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia and Melanesia approximately 1500 BCE. The Samoan origins are currently being reassessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.
Intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained between the eastern Lapita colonies and the archaeological record supports oral tradition and native genealogies that indicate inter-island voyaging and intermarriage&lt;/p&gt;

During his 65-year career, Shaw appeared in dozens of stage performances and more than 40 film and television productions.
Shaw was born and raised in Holt, Norfolk and made his acting debut at age eight at a London theatre. He studied acting at Gresham&#39;s School and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Although he worked primarily on the London stage, he made his Broadway debut in 1929, when he played one of the two murderers in Rope&#39;s End. He appeared in his first film, Caste, in 1930 and quickly began to create a name for himself in motion pictures. Nevertheless, he described himself as a &quot;rotten actor&quot; as a youth and said his success was primarily due to his good looks. He claimed to mature as a performer only after returning from service in the Royal Air Force during World War II.
Shaw was particularly known for his performances in William Shakespeare productions, which were considered daring and ahead of their time. In 1966, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he remained for a decade and delivered some of his most acclaimed performances. He also wrote&lt;/p&gt;

She is the mother of Anakin Skywalker and paternal grandmother to Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. Her first name is derived from Lakshmi, a Hindu goddess. Also, &quot;shmi&quot; is a Hebrew word meaning &quot;my name.&quot;  

In The Phantom Menace, she and her son are introduced as slave of junk merchant Watto on the desert world Tatooine. She welcomes Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) into their home, and tells him that Anakin has no father; she simply became pregnant with him. 

Qui-Gon helps Anakin win his freedom, but cannot get Shmi out of slavery. She allows Anakin to leave with Qui-Gon, assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again. 

In Attack of the Clones, Anakin (Hayden Christensen), now a teenaged Jedi apprentice, senses through the Force that she is in pain. He travels to Tatooine to find her, and upon arriving learns that she had been freed by and married to moisture farmer Cliegg Lars (Jack Thompson) but had recently been abducted by Tusken Raiders. He finds her inside one of their encampments, but it is too late&lt;/p&gt;

It covers a land mass of 28,400&amp;#160;square kilometres (10,965&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi). The capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal.
The Solomon Islands are believed to have been inhabited by Melanesian people for thousands of years. The United Kingdom established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in 1893. In the Second World War, there was fierce fighting between the Americans and the Japanese in the Solomon Islands campaign of 1942&amp;#8211;45, including the Battle of Guadalcanal. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later. The Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy with the Queen of the Solomon Islands, at present Elizabeth II, as the head of state.
Since 1998, ethnic violence, government misconduct, and crime have undermined stability and society. In June 2003, an Australian-led multinational force, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), arrived to restore peace, disarm ethnic militias and improve civil governance.

To the north lie Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe; to the east are Mozambique and Swaziland; while Lesotho is an independent country wholly surrounded by South African territory.
Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for more than 100,000 years. At the time of European contact, the dominant indigenous peoples were tribes who had migrated from other parts of Africa about one thousand years before. From the 4th-5th century CE, Bantu-speaking tribes had steadily moved south, where they displaced, conquered and assimilated original Khoikhoi and San peoples of southern Africa. At the time of European contact, the two major groups were the Xhosa and Zulu peoples.
In 1652, a century and a half after the discovery of the Cape Sea Route, the Dutch East India Company founded a refreshment station at what would become Cape Town. Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the Boers (original Dutch, Flemish, German and French settlers) and the British 1820 Settlers claimed land in&lt;/p&gt;

The South Tarawa population center consists of all the small islets between Bairiki (on the west) to Temaiku/Bonriki on the east. All of several once separate islets are joined by causeways, forming one long islet on the reef along the southern side of the Tarawa Lagoon. There is also a relatively new causeway&amp;#8212;the Japanese Causeway&amp;#8212;that links South Tarawa to Betio, out of South Tarawa. South Tarawa is located at 1&amp;#176;19&#39; North, 172&amp;#176;58&#39; East (1.31667, 172.9667). 
There is a Kiribati Teacher College and a University of the South Pacific campus on South Tarawa. Bairiki is sometimes considered the capital of Kiribati because at one time both the Parliament and the Presidency (and main administrative offices) were located there. The Parliament meets on Ambo islet; various ministries are scattered between South Tarawa, Betio and Christmas Island (ministry of the Line and Phoenix islands).

It was the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, the first of a three-film prequel story to the original film trilogy. It was also Lucas&#39; first film as a director in 22 years, and only his fourth overall. The film follows Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who flee the planet Naboo with Queen Amidala in the hope of finding a peaceful end to a trade dispute. Along the way, the ship must stop for repairs on the planet Tatooine, where the Jedi encounter Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy who is unusually strong with the Force. Meanwhile, they must contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.
Lucas began production when he felt special effects had advanced to the level of what he had envisioned for the film. Shooting took place during 1997 at various locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert. Special effects made extensive use of computer-generated imagery, with some characters and scenarios being completely digital.
The Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, almost sixteen years after the previous film in the&lt;/p&gt;

It is the fifth film to be released in the Star Wars saga and the second in terms of internal chronology.
The film is set 10 years after the events in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a renegade Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padm&amp;#233; Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, 19-year-old Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon, Anakin, Padm&amp;#233;, and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the Separatist territories and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars.
Released on May 16, 2002, Attack of the Clones was the first motion picture to be shot completely on a high definition digital 24-frame system and the first Star Wars film to be internationally out-grossed in the year of its original release.
Ten years have passed since the&lt;/p&gt;

It is the first of six films released in the Star Wars saga: two subsequent films complete the original trilogy, while a prequel trilogy completes the six film saga. Ground-breaking in its use of special effects, unconventional editing, and sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, the original Star Wars is one of the most successful and influential films of all time.
Set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the film follows a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance who are plotting to destroy the Death Star space station, a powerful device created by the evil Galactic Empire. This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmboy Luke Skywalker when he inadvertently acquires the droids carrying the stolen Death Star plans. When the Empire begins a cruel and destructive search for the droids, Skywalker decides to accompany Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on a daring mission to rescue the owner of the droids, rebel leader Princess Leia Organa, and save the galaxy.
Produced with a budget of $11 million and released on May 25, 1977, the film went&lt;/p&gt;

The screenplay, based on a story by George Lucas, was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. It was the second film released in the Star Wars saga, and the fifth in terms of internal chronology.
The film is set three years after the destruction of the Death Star. The villainous Darth Vader and the elite forces of the Galactic Empire are in pursuit of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Vader chases Han and Leia across the galaxy, Luke studies the Force under Jedi Master Yoda. Vader uses Luke&#39;s friends to set a trap for him, leading to a fierce confrontation between the black-armored Sith and the young Jedi which ends with a shocking revelation.
Following a difficult production, The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 21, 1980, and initially received mixed reviews from critics, although it has since grown in esteem, becoming one of the most popular chapters in the Star Wars saga and one of the most highly rated films in history. It earned more than US$538 million worldwide over the original run and several&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;The Star Wars Gangsta Rap is a parody song based on the original Star Wars trilogy. The song was later popularized as a Flash music video and was the first winner of the Audience Choice Award in the Lucasfilm-sponsored Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards.
The Star Wars Gangsta Rap started out as a song, written by Jason Brannon and Chris Crawford, with vocals by Brannon, drum machine by Crawford and Leonard, and keyboard by Brian Leonard. The group billed themselves as Bentframe.
Animator Thomas Lee discovered the rap in 2000 and used it as a basis to practice his developing Flash skills. This became the first (and most widely seen) version of the video. After showing the finished results to Bentframe, they together formed BentTV.
Due to the project&#39;s success, BentTV later created an improved version, referred to as the Special Edition, which debuted at the 2004 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards. The audio track was not changed, but the visuals were completely redrawn, with improved color and shading and more detailed motion, all while emulating the relevant scenes in the movies more closely and adding more. The improvement in animation is analogous to Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;

The film takes place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, and explains why the Jedi Order was extinct in the original trilogy.
Compared to the average fan film, Revelations runs longer (47 minutes, 13 seconds) and was more expensive to make, with a final budget between $15,000 and $20,000.
The destruction of the Jedi Temple was devastating. Accusing the now-defunct Confederacy of Independent Systems of the attack, Emperor Palpatine declares martial law on Coruscant. As the Imperial presence spreads to most systems, Palpatine calls the scattered Jedi order ineffective. Their protests are denounced as treason, all Jedi are declared traitors, and are now fugitives of the Empire.
The film centers on Zhanna&amp;#8212;one of the Emperor&#39;s Hands&amp;#8212;and Taryn Anwar, a Seer who had helped Zhanna hunt down the Jedi without knowing that Zhanna had turned to the dark side. (Seers, the Jedi with visions, are an original contribution to the Star Wars galaxy.) Taryn seeks to redeem herself; her visions lead her to a dangerous ancient Jedi artifact said to give the bearer great power.

The operational conditions on the boundless open spaces of the Far-Northern Galaxy have rapidly become complicated. On secret planets, persons of unknown nationality (a reference to many Georgian-Armenian and moldovian illegal immigrants in Russia) have set up manufacture of illegal alcohol on a galactic scale and are preparing an act of aggression against the peaceful planet Marabu.

The area was rapidly built up in the 19th century, mainly to accomodate immigrant workers and displaced London poor, and developed a reputation for poverty, overcrowding, violence and political dissent. It was severely damaged during the Blitz, with over a third of housing totally destroyed, and then 1960s slum clearance and redevopment replaced most residential streets with tower blocks and modern housing estates, though some Georgian architecture and Victorian era terraced housing survive in patches, such as Arbour Square, the eastern side of Stepney Green and the streets around Matlock Street.
The Siege of Sidney Street took place in Stepney in 1911.
The area has not yet experienced the levels of gentrification seen in nearby Bow, Wapping and Limehouse but some redevelopment has taken place. The former Arbour Square Police Station and the East End Mission building are also being redeveloped.
Stepney is roughly bounded by Commercial Road, part of the A13, in the south, Mile End Road, part of the A11, in&lt;/p&gt;

It is the site of the national Swedish government, the Riksdag (parliament), and the official residence of the Swedish monarch as well as the prime minister. Since 1980, the monarch has resided at Drottningholm Palace outside of Stockholm and uses the Royal Palace of Stockholm as his workplace and official residence. As of 2009, the Stockholm metropolitan area is home to approximately 22% of Sweden&#39;s population, and contributes 28% of Sweden&#39;s gross domestic product. Stockholm is the most populous city in Sweden with a population of 829,417 in the municipality (2009), 1.25 million in the urban area (2005), and 2 million in the metropolitan area (2009).
Founded circa 1250, Stockholm has long been one of Sweden&#39;s cultural, media, political, and economic centres. Its strategic location on 14 islands on the south-central east coast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake M&amp;#228;laren, by the Stockholm archipelago, has been historically important. Stockholm has been nominated by GaWC as a global city, with a ranking of Alpha-. In The 2008 Global Cities Index, Stockholm ranked 24th in the world,&lt;/p&gt;

His wife Kay assisted her husband on several occasions; their son Graham was also a prolific make-up artist before his death in 1986.

The nation, as well as its people, are named after the 19th century king Mswati II.
Swaziland is a small country, no more than 200&amp;#160;km north to south and 130&amp;#160;km east to west. The western half is mountainous, descending to a lowveld region to the east. The eastern border with Mozambique and South Africa is dominated by the escarpment of the Lebombo Mountains. The climate is temperate in the west, but may reach 40 degrees in summer in the lowveld. Rainfall occurs mainly in the summer and may reach 2 m in the west.
The area that Swaziland now covers has been continuously inhabited since prehistory. Today, the population is primarily ethnic Swazis whose language is Swati, though English is spoken as a second language. The Swazi people descend from the southern Bantu who migrated from Central Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Anglo Boer war saw Britain make Swaziland a protectorate under its direct control. Swaziland gained independence in 1968. Swaziland is a member of the Southern&lt;/p&gt;

The United Republic of Tanzania is a unitary republic composed of 26 mikoa (regions). The current head of state is President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, elected in 2005. Since 1996, the official capital of Tanzania has been Dodoma, where parliament and some government offices are located.

The name is derived from an early Georgian form T&#39;pilisi and it was officially known as Tiflis (&amp;#4322;&amp;#4324;&amp;#4312;&amp;#4314;&amp;#4312;&amp;#4321;&amp;#4312;) until 1936. The city covers an area of 726&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; (280.3 square miles) and has 1,480,000 inhabitants.
Founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang Gorgasali, the Georgian King of Kartli (Iberia), and made into a capital in the 6th century, Tbilisi is a significant industrial, social, and cultural center. The city is also emerging as an important transit route for global energy and trade projects. Located strategically at the crossroads between Europe and Asia and lying along the historic Silk Road routes, Tbilisi has often been the point of contention between various rivaling powers and empires. The history of the city can be seen by its architecture, where the Haussmannized Rustaveli Avenue and downtown are blended with the narrower streets of the medieval Narikala district.
The demographics of the city is diverse and historically it has been home to peoples from different cultures, religions and ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;

It stretches inland from the River Thames to Bushy Park. Formerly it was in the county of Middlesex, which was formerly also its postal county.
Teddington is mostly residential but is bisected by an almost continuous road of shops, offices and other facilities running from the river to Bushy Park. There are three clusters of offices on this route: on the river Teddington Studios and Haymarket Group form a media hub whilst on the edge of Bushy Park the NPL, NWML and LGC form a scientific centre. Around Teddington Station and the town centre are a number of offices in industries such as Direct Marketing and IT, and offices outside this axis include Tearfund. Several riverside businesses and houses were redeveloped in the last quarter of the twentieth century as blocks of riverside flats. The area has been described in the national press as &quot;leafy&quot;.
Teddington gives its name to Teddington Lock, which is across the river at Ham and is accessible via the Teddington Lock Footbridges. This marks the upstream limit of&lt;/p&gt;

Stamp, the eldest of five children, was born in Stepney, London in 1939, the son of Ethel Esther (n&amp;#233;e Perrott) and Thomas Stamp, who was a tugboat captain. His early years were spent in Canal Road, Bow, in the East End of London, but later in his childhood the family moved to Plaistow, Essex (now Greater London). His brother, Chris, is a rock &#39;n roll impresario credited with helping to bring The Who to prominence during the 1960s. As his father was away for long periods with his job in the Merchant Navy, the young Stamp was mostly raised by his mother, grandmother, and aunts. He grew up idolizing the film actor Gary Cooper after his mother had taken him to see Beau Geste at the age of three. He was also inspired by James Dean.
On leaving school Stamp worked in a variety of advertising agencies in London, working his way up to a very respectable wage. Deep down he wanted to be an actor, a realisation that came when Stamp found he no longer had to serve two years National Service after being rejected for once having treatment on his feet.
Stamp made his film debut in Peter Ustinov&#39;s film adaptation of Herman Melville&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;

Territory of New Guinea was the name given to the Australia-controlled, League of Nations-mandated territory in the north eastern part of the island of New Guinea, and surrounding islands, between 1920 and 1949. The south-eastern part of the island of New Guinea was a separate Australian colony, the Territory of Papua, until 1949.
The Australian mandate was based on the previous German New Guinea, which was captured and occupied by Australian forces in 1914, during World War I. Much of the Territory of New Guinea was occupied by Japanese forces during World War II; Rabaul, on the island of New Britain was a major Japanese base (see New Guinea campaign).
Under the Papua New Guinea Provisional Administration Act, (1945&amp;#8211;46), the territories of Papua and New Guinea were combined in an administrative union.&lt;/p&gt;

It is located at the north-east of the Caribbean Sea in the Atlantic Ocean north of Cuba, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti) and the Caribbean Sea, northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and southeast of the United States of America (nearest to the state of Florida). Its total land area is almost 14&amp;#160;000&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;, with an estimated population of 330,000. Its capital is Nassau.
Originally inhabited by Arawakan Taino people, The Bahamas were the site of Columbus&#39; first landfall in the New World in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans (as the Bahamian Taino settlers referred to themselves) to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 to 1650, when British colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.
The Bahamas became a Crown Colony in 1718 when the British clamped down on piracy. Following the American War of Independence, thousands of pro-British loyalists and enslaved Africans moved to The Bahamas and set up a&lt;/p&gt;

It is also, as Bronx County, the newest of the 62 counties of New York State. Located north of Manhattan and Queens, and south of Westchester County, the Bronx is the only borough not primarily located on an island. In 2009, the Census Bureau estimated that the borough&#39;s population on July 1, 2008 was 1,391,903, inhabiting a land area of 42 square miles (109 square kilometers). This makes the Bronx the fourth-most-populated of the five boroughs, the fourth-largest in land area, and the third-highest in density of population.
The Bronx is divided by the Bronx River into a hillier section in the west, closer to Manhattan, and the flatter East Bronx, closer to Long Island. The West Bronx was annexed to New York City (then largely confined to Manhattan) in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895. The Bronx first assumed a distinct legal identity when it became a borough of Greater New York in 1898. Bronx County, with the same boundaries as the borough, was separated from New York County (afterwards coextensive with the Borough of Manhattan) as of January 1, 1914.

The Gambia is the smallest country on mainland Africa, bordered to the north, east, and south by Senegal, with a small coast on the Atlantic Ocean in the west.
Its borders roughly correspond to the path of the Gambia River, the nation&#39;s namesake, which flows through the country&#39;s center and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Its size is almost 10,500&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; with an estimated population of	1,700,000.
On 18 February 1965, The Gambia was granted independence from the United Kingdom and joined The Commonwealth. Banjul is The Gambia&#39;s capital, but the largest conurbation is Serekunda.
The Gambia shares historical roots with many other west African nations in the slave trade, which was key to the establishment of a colony on the Gambia river, first by the Portuguese and later by the British. Since gaining independence in 1965, The Gambia has enjoyed relative stability, with the exception of a brief period of military rule in 1994.
An agriculturally rich country, its economy is dominated by farming, fishing, and tourism. About a third of the population live&lt;/p&gt;

The Valley has few examples of colonial architecture due to the relocation of Anguilla&#39;s administration to St. Kitts in 1825, though Wallblake House, built in 1787, still stands and is used as a rectory by the adjacent church. New shops have opened in new buildings and renovated West Indian-style cottages. Old shops have been modernized and have enlarged their stocks as well as their space.
The ruins of the Old Court House are located on Crocus Hill, the island&#39;s highest point. All that remains are the broken walls of a few basement jail cells. At Cross Roads at the western edge of The Valley is Wallblake House, a plantation home built around 1787 that is now owned by the Catholic Church (the parish priest lives there) and St. Gerard&#39;s Catholic Church, with its highly original facade of pebbles, stones, cement, wood and tile.

A member of the tall, thin Pau&#39;an species, Tion Medon had an unsettling appearance to some, with glassy, sunken black eyes and a mouth of crooked teeth. However, appearances were deceptive, as Tion Medon was an accommodating, helpful being. As Port Administrator of his sinkhole sanctuary on Utapau, Tion welcomed guests to his city, offering them his services.
Longevity came naturally to the Pau&#39;ans, and Tion Medon had been Master of Port Administration for Pau City for more than 200-standard years by the time of the Clone Wars. A descendant of Timon Medon, who is credited with unifying Utapau, Tion watched in horror as his committee members were killed by MagnaGuards. Like all Pau&#39;ans, Tion preferred darkness to sunlight, and raw meat to cooked.

The country covers an area of 5,128&amp;#160;square kilometres (1,980&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) and consists of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and numerous smaller landforms. Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the main islands; Tobago is much smaller, comprising about 6% of the total area and 4% of the entire population which is estimated at 1.3 million (2005). The nation lies outside the hurricane belt.
Trinidad and Tobago was a Spanish colony from the times of Christopher Columbus to 1802, when it was ceded to Britain. The country obtained independence in 1962. Unlike most of the English-speaking Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago&#39;s economy is primarily industrial, with an emphasis on petroleum and petrochemicals. Trinidad and Tobago has a sound macroeconomic framework and a long tradition of institutional stability. It&lt;/p&gt;

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie southeast of Mayaguana in the Bahamas and north of the island of Hispaniola. Cockburn Town, the capital, is situated about 1,042&amp;#160;kilometres (647&amp;#160;mi) east-southeast of Miami in the United States. The islands have a total land area of 430&amp;#160;square kilometres (170&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi). The islands are geographically contiguous to the Bahamas, but are politically a separate entity.
The total population is about 36,000, of whom approximately 22,500 live on Providenciales in the Caicos Islands. Cockburn Town, the capital, is on Grand Turk Island.
In August 2009, the United Kingdom suspended the Turks and Caicos&#39; self-government after allegations of ministerial corruption. The prerogative of the ministerial government and the House of Assembly are vested in the islands&#39; incumbent governor, Gordon Wetherell, for a period of up to two years.

Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. It comprises four reef islands and five true atolls. Its population of 12,373 makes it the second-least-populated sovereign state in the world, with only Vatican City having fewer inhabitants. In terms of physical land size, at just 26&amp;#160;square kilometres (10&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, larger only than the Vatican City at 0.44&amp;#160;km (0.17&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi), Monaco at 1.95&amp;#160;km (0.75&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) and Nauru at 21&amp;#160;km (8.1&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi).
The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesian people. The islands came under the UK&#39;s sphere of influence in the late 19th century. The Ellice Islands were administered by Britain as part of a protectorate from 1892 to 1916 and as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1916 to 1974. In 1974, the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu, separating from the Gilbert Islands which became Kiribati upon independence. Tuvalu became fully independent&lt;/p&gt;

It is bordered on the east by Kenya, on the north by Sudan, on the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the southwest by Rwanda, and on the south by Tanzania. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, which is also bordered by Kenya and Tanzania.
Uganda takes its name from the Buganda kingdom, which encompassed a portion of the south of the country including the capital Kampala. Fifty-one percent of the population of the country lives slightly below the international poverty line of US $1.25 a day.
The people of Uganda were hunter-gatherers until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago. Bantu-speaking populations, who were probably from central and western Africa, migrated to the southern parts of the country. These groups brought and developed ironworking skills and new ideas of social and political organization. The Empire of Kitara in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries represents the earliest forms of formal organization, followed by the kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara, and in later centuries, Buganda and&lt;/p&gt;

Ukraine&#39;s modern history began with the East Slavs. From at least the 9th&amp;#160;century, Ukraine was a centre of the medieval living area of the East Slavs. This state, known as Kievan Rus&#39;, became a large and powerful nation, but disintegrated in the 12th&amp;#160;century. After the Great Northern War, Ukraine was divided among a number of regional powers, and by the 19th&amp;#160;century, the largest part of Ukraine was integrated into the Russian Empire, with the rest under Austro-Hungarian control.

The U.S. Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of Saint Croix, Saint John and Saint Thomas, along with the much smaller but historically distinct Water Island, and many other surrounding minor islands. The main islands have nicknames often used by locals: &quot;Twin City&quot; (St. Croix), &quot;Rock City&quot; (St. Thomas), &quot;Love City&quot; (St. John), and &quot;Small City&quot; (Water Island).
The total land area of the territory is 133.73&amp;#160;square miles (346.4&amp;#160;km). As of the 2000 census the population was 108,612.
The Virgin Islands were originally settled by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawaks. The islands were named by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over the next three hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain, The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway.

Valletta contains buildings from the 16th century onwards, built during the rule of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem (the Knights Hospitaller). The city is essentially Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture in selected areas, though World War II left major scars on the city. The City of Valletta was officially recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.
The city is named for Jean Parisot de la Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from an Ottoman invasion in 1565. The official name given by the Order of Saint John was Humilissima Civitas Valletta &amp;#8212; The Most Humble City of Valletta, or Citt&amp;#224; Umilissima in Italian.

It is named for British Captain George Vancouver, who explored the area in the 1790s. The name Vancouver itself originates from the Dutch &quot;van Coevorden&quot;, denoting somebody from Coevorden, a city in the Netherlands.
The largest metropolitan area in Western Canada, Vancouver ranks third largest in the country and the city proper ranks eighth. According to the 2006 census Vancouver had a population of 578,041 and its Census Metropolitan Area exceeded 2.1 million people. Its residents are ethnically and linguistically diverse; 52% do not speak English as their first language.
Logging sawmills established in 1867 in the area known as Gastown became the nucleus around which the townsite grew, and Vancouver was incorporated as a city in 1886. By 1887, the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport, which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient, Eastern Canada, and London. The Port Metro Vancouver is now the busiest and largest in Canada, as well as the fourth largest port (by tonnage) in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is some 1,750&amp;#160;kilometres (1,090&amp;#160;mi) east of northern Australia, 500&amp;#160;kilometres (310&amp;#160;mi) northeast of New Caledonia, west of Fiji, and southeast of the Solomon Islands, near New Guinea.
Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people. Europeans began to settle in the area in the late 18th century. In the 1880s France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the country, and in 1906 they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through a British-French Condominium. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was created in 1980.
The prehistory of Vanuatu is obscure; archaeological evidence supports the commonly held theory that peoples speaking Austronesian languages first came to the islands some 4,000 years ago. Pottery fragments have been found dating back to 1300&amp;#8211;1100 B.C.E.

It has an area of approximately 44 hectares (110&amp;#160;acres), and a population of just over 800.
Vatican City was established in 1929. It is distinct from the Holy See, which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.147 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe. Ordinances of Vatican City are published in Italian; official documents of the Holy See are issued mainly in Latin. The two entities even have distinct passports: the Holy See, not being a country, only issues diplomatic and service passports; the state of Vatican City issues normal passports. Very few passports are issued by either authority.
The Lateran Treaty in 1929, which brought the city-state into existence, spoke of it as a new creation (Preamble and Article III), not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756-1870) that had previously encompassed central&lt;/p&gt;

It is also Laos&#39; largest city. The estimated population of the city is 200,000 (2005) while the number of people living in the Vientiane metropolitan area (the entire Vientiane Prefecture and parts of Vientiane Province) is believed to be over 730,000. Vientiane is located at 17&amp;#176;58&#39; North, 102&amp;#176;36&#39; East (17.9667, 102.6).

The name of the city is derived from Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism.

The City of Washington was originally a separate municipality within the Territory of Columbia until an act of Congress in 1871 effectively merged the City and the Territory into a single entity called the District of Columbia. It is for this reason that the city, while legally named the District of Columbia, is known as Washington, D.C. The city shares its name with the U.S. state of Washington, which is located on the country&#39;s Pacific coast.
The city is located on the north bank of the Potomac River and is bordered by the states of Virginia to the southwest and Maryland to the other sides. The District has a resident population of 599,657; because of commuters from the surrounding suburbs, its population rises to over one&amp;#160;million during the workweek.

Among Watto&#39;s belongings are the slaves Shmi Skywalker and her son, Anakin. He acquires them after winning a podracing bet with Gardulla the Hutt, and he puts them both to work in his store. Anakin demonstrates an incredible aptitude for equipment repair, and Watto decides to profit from it by having the boy fix various broken equipment in the store. He eventually loses Anakin in a bet between Qui-Gon Jinn when he bets on a competing podracer, Sebulba, who is defeated by Anakin.
Watto has been criticized for his apparent stereotyping of Eastern European people, particularly Jewish and Arab people due to his sloped nose, stubble, slave-ownership, and greed amongst other stereotypes which are commonly held stereotypes against the two races. However, there are some contingents who conclude he was based on the typical characters played by French actor Raimu, particularly Cesar from the&lt;/p&gt;

Pygram was born in Cootamundra, New South Wales and raised in Wagga Wagga, where, as a teen, he was a drummer in a dance group. He initially studied art at Riverina College, but later changed majors to primary school education. While in college, he became a member of a theater troupe known as the Riverina Trucking Company.
Before acting in films and television, he was a regular on the Australian theatre circuit. In 2005, he made a brief cameo in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith as a young Grand Moff Tarkin, because of his resemblance to Peter Cushing, who portrayed the same character 28 years previously in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.
Due to the brevity of his Star Wars cameo, and the makeup he wore on Farscape, Pygram&#39;s face may now be known best for his appearance on the TV show Lost, as a faith healer named Isaac of Uluru.
Pygram also plays the drums in a band named Signal Room (formerly called Number 96) along with his co-star in Farscape, Anthony&lt;/p&gt;

The 2001 census determined Windhoek&#39;s population was 233,529. A population influx from all over Namibia has caused researchers to estimate the figure to be well over 300,000.
Due to its relative size Windhoek is even more so than other capitals the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. Virtually every national enterprise has its headquarters here. The University of Namibia is here, as is the country&#39;s only theatre, most of Namibia&#39;s governmental institutions, and all major media bodies. City of Windhoek&#39;s budget nearly equals that of all other Namibian local authorities combined.
The city of Windhoek is traditionally known by two names: /Ai//Gams, (Khoekhoe: hot springs) and Otjomuise (Otjiherero: place of steam). Both traditional names reference the hot springs near today&#39;s city centre.
Theories vary on how the place got its modern name of Windhoek. Most believe the name Windhoek is derived from the Afrikaans word Wind-Hoek&lt;/p&gt;

It lies in the centre of the nation at an elevation of about 750 metres (2,500&amp;#160;ft) above sea level.
Yaound&amp;#233; was founded in 1888 by German traders as a base for the ivory trade and an agricultural research station. It was occupied by Belgian troops during World War I. After Germany&#39;s defeat, France became the colonial power in eastern Cameroon. Yaound&amp;#233; became the capital of French Cameroon, and continues today as the capital of the Republic of Cameroon.
Major industries in Yaound&amp;#233; include tobacco, dairy products, breweries, clay, glass goods, and lumber. It is also a regional distribution center for coffee, cocoa, copra, sugar cane, and rubber.
The city centre houses government offices, some hotels, and the central market. The Bastos neighbourhood, with most homes owned by Cameroonians, is home to foreign embassies and the expatriate European community (drawn mainly from the diplomatic corps). The presidential palace and compound is in the Etoudi neighborhood.

The neighbouring countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia to the south, and Angola to the west. The capital city is Lusaka, located in the south-central part of the country. It is the first and still the only country in Africa that manufactures mobile phones. The population is concentrated mainly around the capital Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt to the northwest.
Zambia has been inhabited for thousands of years by hunter-gatherers and migrating tribes. After sporadic visits by European explorers starting in the 18th century, Zambia was gradually claimed and occupied by the British as protectorate of Northern Rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century.
On 24 October 1964, the protectorate gained independence with the new name of Zambia, derived from the Zambezi river which flows through the country. Zambia was governed by president Kenneth Kaunda of the socialist United National Independence Party from 1964 until 1991. From 1991 to 2002, Zambia was governed by&lt;/p&gt;

It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest and Mozambique to the east. Zimbabwe has three official languages: English, Shona (a Bantu language), and Ndebele (also a Bantu language).
Zimbabwe began as a part of the British crown colony of Rhodesia. President Robert Mugabe is the head of State and Commander in Chief of the armed forces. Morgan Tsvangirai is the Prime Minister. Mugabe has been in power since the country&#39;s long war for independence. Although initially during the 1980s his administration was credited with improving the standard of living and the economy, his rule has been characterized by gross economic mismanagement, hyperinflation, and widespread reports of human rights abuses. The collapse of the nation&#39;s economy and widespread poverty and unemployment has increased support for Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara and&lt;/p&gt;

It is set between Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Distributed by Warner Bros., the film premiered on August 10, 2008 at the Grauman&#39;s Egyptian Theatre, while screening in wide-release on August 14, 2008 across Australia, and August 15 in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars is the seventh Star Wars feature to be released in theaters in North America (the eighth in Europe, as Caravan of Courage receiving a cinematic release there in 1984) and is the first animated theatrical film for the franchise. The film is also the first to be distributed by Warner Bros. instead of 20th Century Fox, while also being the first theatrical Star Wars film to be directed by someone other than George Lucas since Return of the Jedi&#39;s Richard Marquand. It is also the only theatrical Star Wars film not scored by John Williams; Kevin Kiner was hired to compose brand new music, which was combined with selected John Williams melodies from previous Star Wars movies.

There is no universally accepted definition of the word &quot;continent&quot;; the lay definition is &quot;One of the main continuous bodies of land on the earth&#39;s surface.&quot; (Oxford English Dictionary). By that definition, the continent of Australia includes only the Australian mainland, and not nearby islands such as Tasmania or New Guinea. From the perspective of geology or physical geography, however, a &quot;continent&quot; may be understood to include the continental shelf (the submerged adjacent area) and the islands on the shelf, which are taken to be structurally part of the continent. By that definition Tasmania, New Guinea and other nearby islands such as the Aru Islands and Raja Ampat Islands are part of the Australian continent since they are part of the same geological landmass. These islands are separated by seas overlying the continental shelf &amp;#8212; the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, the Timor Sea between Australia and Timor, and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania.
