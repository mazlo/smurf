Schema Matching by Utilizing Regular Expressions and Feature Extraction.

This is a tool for instance-based schema matching.

You can invoke the tool at the command-line by typing:

java -jar org.gesis.smurf.jar <path_to_source_ontology> <path_to_target_ontology> <path_to_pattern_file>

Regular Expressions in the pattern file must follow the following conventions:

<pattern><tab><weighting>, e.g. "[0-9]{3}	0.4" (without the "). 

Each line denotes one pattern. All of the patterns contained in the file are considered as a pattern class, which match a certain data type, e.g. a date. The higher the weighting (between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.8) the higher the confidence that this pattern truely matches a date value.
